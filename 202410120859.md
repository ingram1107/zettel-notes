# Rust Function Pointer

Rust function pointer has the same syntax to function declaration without
parameter specification. It is commonly used for [Integrative Programming](202311041150.md).
Function pointer implements all closure traits, that is, `Fn`, `FnMut`, and
`FnOnce`, therefore it can be used to refer closure.
