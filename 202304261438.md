# End-to-End Congestion Control

End-to-end congestion control is a method of [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
that observes the network, from the POV of the end system, by looking at
indirect cues such as packet loss and delay without explicit support from the
[Network Layer](202206131702.md). [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
takes this congestion control approach. [TCP](202503182241.md) can use segment loss or increase
[round-trip](202303292133.md) delay as an indicator to adjust its window size
accordingly.
