# Go-Back-N (GBN) Protocol

GBN protocol is a kind of [Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol](202303141902.md)
that can send multiple packets without waiting for acknowledgment. It defines a
**window size** of $N$ which contains the maximum number of slots for packets
which are sent but not yet acknowledged or not yet sent. The sender maintains
the upper and lower bounds of window size, and receiver maintains the sequence
number of the next in-order packet. [Flow Control](202209302245.md) and
[Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md) are deployed.

**Note**: GBN protocol also known as sliding-window protocol as the window slot
slide once to the next one for each ACK.

When the window is full on the sender side, and if a timeout is reached, it
resents $n$ number of sent but not yet acknowledged packets. To handle to
overflow, the sender can simply route the packet(s) to the upper layer, buffer
the data, or use synchronisation mechanism such as [Semaphore](202201291602.md)
for the upper [layer](202206131632.md) to call once the window no longer full.
On the receiver side, if the packet is not correct or not in order (cumulative
acknowledgment), then it resends the most recently successfully received
packet's acknowledgment (ACK) to the other end. 

That being said, GBN protocol is not perfect when encountering large window size
and bandwidth delay. A single packet error can result in large retransmission of
the packets within the window (in the pipeline), including those that are
correct but out-of-order, which is wasteful. The solution is to use [Selective Repeat (SR) Protocol](202303211253.md).
