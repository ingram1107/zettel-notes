# Design Pattern

Design Pattern is a communicating object and class that is customised to solve a
general design problem in a particular context.[^gangOfFour] It abstrats and
identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make an object and
class reusable.

We know that an application, a toolkit or a framework needs to be redesign using
a Design Pattern when:
- the creation of an object needs to explicitly specify a class
- there is a dependency on specific operations
- there is a dependency on hardware and software platform
- there is a dependency on object representations or implementations
- there is a dependency on algorithms
- the coupling is tight (highly depending classes on each other)
- functionality extension have to be done by subclassing
- it is unable to alter classes conveniently

Design Patterns could be roughly classified into three categories:
- [Creational Design Patterns](202304291216.md)
- [Structural Design Patterns](202304291226.md)
- [Behavioural Design Patterns](202306232245.md)

Several Design Patterns are presented below:
- [State Pattern](202210211637.md)
- [Null Object Pattern](202211162216.md)
- [Observer Pattern](202211231132.md)
- [Mediator Pattern](202211241530.md)
- [Composite Pattern](202302101843.md)
- [Strategy Pattern](202302172008.md)
- [Decorator Pattern](202302232121.md)
- [Memento Pattern](202302232319.md)
- [Flyweight Pattern](202303071312.md)
- [Iterator Pattern](202303131007.md)
- [Visitor Pattern](202303071231.md)
- [Proxy Pattern](202303132109.md)
- [Bridge Pattern](202303261633.md)
- [Command Pattern](202304081543.md)
- [Facade Pattern](202304291155.md)
- [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](202306231904.md)
- [Interpreter Pattern](202306231912.md)
- [Template Method Pattern](202306232036.md)
- [Builder Pattern](202304291133.md)

Figure below shows the relationship between each Design Pattern:
