# Rust Generic

To specify a default generic type parameter, one can declare it as in the form
of `<PlaceholderType=ConcreteType>` like `<Rhs=Self>` shown as below:

```rust
trait Add<Rhs=Self> {
    type Output;

    fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
}
```

Rust by default doesn't allow operator overloading. To do this, we have to
import from `std::ops` and implement the traits listed in the library to the
corresponding class.

With default generic type parameter, we can extend a type without breaking the
existing code and allow customisation for specific cases where most users won't
ever need

Type aliasing also allow generic type.
