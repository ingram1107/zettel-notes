# Timer Approach Packet Loss Detection

To detect packet loss in [networking](202303141902.md), we can design the
[Protocol](202209302229.md) to wait for a defined period of time such that
packet loss is likely, but not guarantee, to have happened. Then, a
retransmission of the packet is initiated regardless, even though ACK may
eventually arrive. Since this introduces the possibility of duplicate packets, a
sequence number should be attached to data packets.


This approach requires a countdown timer to interrupt the sender.
