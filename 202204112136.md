# Topological Sort

Topological sort is an algorithm that sort the vertices of a
#[directed acyclic graph](202204112118.md) in such that it respect the ordering of
the vertices in this original graph. We could use the indegree (the incoming
edges) to determine the order of the vertices.

## Analysis

- If naively do a sequential search for a vertex with indegree 0 in the array
  that store the corresponding indegree value of the vertices, the algorithm
  will result in $O(\vert V \vert^2)$.
- When optimised with [202112031157](202112031157.md) or [202112101836](202112101836.md), it results in
  $O(\vert E \vert + \vert V \vert)$

## Implementation

**Note**: This algorithm uses [202112101836](202112101836.md) where all vertices of indegree 0
will be placed into the queue initially or upon decremented.

```c
void Topsort(Graph G)
{
  Queue Q;
  int Counter = 0;
  Vertex V, W;

  Q = CreateQueue(NumVertex);
  MakeEmpty(Q);
  for each vertex V
    if (Indegree[V] == 0)
      Enqueue(V, Q);

  while (!IsEmpty(Q)) {
    V = Dequeue(Q);
    TopNum[V] = ++Counter;  // Assign next number

    for each W adjacent to V
      if (--Indegree[W] == 0)
        Enqueue(W, Q);
  }

  if (Counter != NumVertex)
    Error("Graph has a cycle");

  DisposeQueue(Q);
}
```
