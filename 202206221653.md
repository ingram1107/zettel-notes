# Rust Drop

Drop is a #[202204061235](202204061235.md) which could be used for [automatic resource clean up](202202012316.md)# when the object or variable is out of scope. It is typically implemented in #[202111301656](202111301656.md). To implement the trait Drop, we need to implement the method `drop` for the structure:

```rust
impl Drop for MyStruct {
		fn drop(&mut self) {
				println!("Automatic resource clean up for MyStruct");
		}
}
```

However, we can't directly call the method `drop` in order to clean the resource earlier. And there is no way for Rust to disable automatic resource clean up mechanism which even if there is, it is unwise to do so. For that purpose, use `std::mem::drop` instead. (You can simply call `drop({variable})` as it is included in the Rust prelude)
