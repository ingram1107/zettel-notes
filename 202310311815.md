# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS is a [cloud](202210012158.md) model in which the tools for application
development and middleware systems are offered to application developers over
the Internet. The developers don't need to worry the underlying infrastructure
in order to build and deliver applications and services. However, them have to
deal directly with the operating system and development tools so that they are
compatible with the [Cloud Infrastructure](202312070843.md). Examples are
Heroku, Google App Engine, Google Cloud Platform, SAP HANA Cloud Platform, and
[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](202401152157.md).
