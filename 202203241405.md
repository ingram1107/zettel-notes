# Exception Safety

An exception-safe function leaks no resources and don't allow the #data-structure
to be corrupted. ([Meyers (2025)](lit/@Meyer2005.md)) Such function can provide
**basic**, **strong**, or **nothrow** guarantees. Note that what level of
exception safety can be guaranteed by the function is determined by its
implementation, not its declaration.

**Note**: Function's parameter(s) can also affect its exception-safety
guarantee. [RAII](202202012306.md) class can be used to contain them.

**Note**: Most of the legacy C++ standard library functions are not
exception-safe.

Function with basic exception-safety guarantees that program will remain in
(any) valid state, i.e., there will be no corrupted data and objects are in
internally consistent state.

Those that with strong guarantee promises that the program state remain
unchanged when an exception was thrown. Such program can only be in two states:
either in an expected state after a successful execution or return to its
previous state. We can say that such function is atomic.
[Meyers](lit/@Meyer2005.md) suggests preferring strong-guaranteed function.

Nothrow guarantee is the strongest exception-safety guarantee among the threes.
It means that the function will never throw an exception, and it does what it
said. All C++ built-in types promise nothrow.

**Note**: `throw()` declaration doesn't mean that the function will not throw an
exception. It declares, instead, that the function could indicate serious
errors, and they should be managed by `unexpected()` function.

**Note**: Document the decisions on exception safety level of implemented
function.

For function with the modifier `noexcept`, if it encounters any kind of
exception, it will simply call `terminate()` which immediately terminate the
current running program.

Avoid throwing exception in destructor as it violates the
[RAII](202202012306.md) philosophy. Instead, we should provide a regular
function to perform resource management in order to react to the exception
accordingly. We can choose to either terminate or swallow the exceptions coming
from its scape as the default behaviour.

## To secure a strong guarantee

In his book, [Meyers](lit/@Meyer2005.md) suggests changing indicator only after
it is certain that something has happened and use [RAII](202202012306.md)
classes (like smart pointers) to manage resources. To further strengthen the
*strong* guarantee, we can utilise copy-and-swap by implementing [Pointer to Implementation (PIMPL)](202307101457.md)
(Handler class).

## Considerations

The function(s) with weaker guarantee can compromise the exception-safety of the
entire system unless the exceptions are carefully and thoroughly handled. In
Meyers' word, "A function can usually offer a guarantee no stronger than the
weakest guarantee of the functions it calls".

Other consideration is the possible **side effects** on non-local data.
Furthermore, strong guarantee comes with the cost in efficiency or complexity,
in which we may have to retreat to provide a basic guarantee instead.
