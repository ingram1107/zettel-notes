# Interaction Design (ID)

ID is designing interactive products to accommodate the way people communicate
and interact in their everyday and working lives. It is the primary concern of
[Human Computer Interaction (HCI)](202303242108.md) that is related to computing
system. It focuses on the users' [cognitive](202304291456.md) ability such as
*attention*, *perception*, *recognition*, and *memory*. The goals of interaction
design are to produce a usable product that is **easy** to learn (learn by
recognition), **effective** (done the task without hassle), **enjoyable**. It is
recommended to involve users throughout the project development for feedback and
identify specific [Usability](202303242139.md) and [User Experience (UX)](202303242126.md)
goals (clear documented). Take on the advices from [UI/UX Design Recommendation](202304291522.md).
The [iteration](202305061342.md), that is repeat interaction with the object,
needed throughout the core activities.

**Note**: The user involvement in the project will help identify users' needs
and wants, and eliminate incorrect assumptions. There will be no one size that
fits all. The user's sensitivities and capabilities are likely to be taken into
account.

Several terms are synonym to ID such as:
- user interface design (UI)
- software design
- user-centred design
- product design
- web design
- experience design (UX)

The process of ID involves: First, identifying the user needs and wants
(limitations and suggest flows), and establishing
[Requirements](202303251303.md) for [User Experience (UX)](202303242126.md) via
case studies. Then, developing alternative design. Building interactive
[prototypes](202207120959.md) that can be communicated and assessed by the
involved users. Last but not least, [evaluating](202305061338.md) what is being
built throughout the process and the user experience it offers by finding the
users and gather their feedback. We could benefit from adhering to
[Design Principles](202304081725.md) for great usability and user experience.
