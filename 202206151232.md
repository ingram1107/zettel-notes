# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

TCP is a commonly used [Protocol](202209302229.md)# in
#[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md) defined by RFC 793, RFC
1122, RFC 1323, RFC 2018, and RFC 2581. It is a #[Transport Layer](202206131837.md)
protocol according to the classification of #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
It provides reliable data transfer, [Flow Control](202209302245.md), and
[congestion control](202304261438.md). In addition, it also provides byte-stream
abstraction where there is no need to know how the byte stream will reach to the
destination. The demultiplexing of the TCP (delivering of packets to
corresponding [socket](202202172152.md)) is based on the source and destination
[IP Address](202206281021.md) and [port numbers](202206151841.md).

TCP is designed to be *connection-oriented* and *reliable*, in contrast to [User
Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md). This means that connection must be
established first (using **three-way handshake**) via a full-duplex channel
point-to-point and maintained by the protocol during a transmission. Because of
this nature, TCP doesn't allow multicasting. The requester will first send out a
control bit SYN (stand for synchronisation), which is set to 1, and its Initial
Sequence Number (ISN), which is [randomly](202207162147.md) generated, to the
server. Upon receiving the packet, the server allocates buffers and variables
for the connection, then sends back a packet to the requester that contains the
control bit SYN and ACK (stand for acknowledgement) set to 1, acknowledgement
number field set to incremented requester's ISN, and its own ISN. From now on,
the requester will assume the connection is well established, and it will
allocate buffers and variables and send packets, may include data (limited by
[maximum segment size](202303282019.md)), to the server with incremented ~~SYN
and~~ acknowledgement number (~~same to~~ based on the server ISN) with the ACK
bit set as 1. This way, TCP can guarantee the eventual orderly delivery of the
packets.

**Note**: The allocation of the buffers and variables from the server side is
susceptible to the [SYN Flooding](202304261356.md).

In case of the arrived TCP packet doesn't match the open sockets in terms of
port number and/or [IP Address](202206281021.md), the server will send a packet
with the RST bit set to 1 to indicate there is no socket to handle such TCP
packet and tell the requester don't resend it again.

To close the connection, the requester must act as an initiator to send out a
packet with FIN bit flipped to 1 and wait to received server's ACK packet. The
server then send the same FIN packet to the requester and wait for the
requester's ACK packet to arrive. On the server side, once the final ACK packet
arrived, it immediately destroys all the related [socket](202202172152.md)
resources. On the other hand, the client will wait at least 30 seconds (or 1 or 2
minutes depending on the implementation) before shutting down the resources. The
waiting is necessary to handle a situation when the final ACK was lost during
the transmission.

It breaks messages into **segments** (its [Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)#)
and reassemble at the destination. If there is a failure on sending such
messages, TCP will resend it. It also provides virtual circuits between
application. At the end, the connection will be torn down if there is no need
for it.

The header of a TCP segment include the following information:
- source port number (16 bits)
- destination port number (16 bits)
- sequence number (32 bits, the byte-stream number of the first byte in TCP
  segment, depending on MSS, it is initialised in a random number)
- [acknowledgement](202303141902.md) number (32 bits, the first missing stream
  byte or next expected byte)
- header length (4 bits, depends on the option field)
- flag (6 bits, including ACK, RST [reset], SYN [setup], FIN [teardown], PSH
  [immediately passing data to the upper layer], URG [mark the packet as urgent
  indicated by upper layer, the last byte is defined by urgent data pointer])
- receive window (16 bits, defines number of bytes the receiver willing to
  accept, useful for [Flow Control](202209302245.md))
- Internet checksum
- Urgent data pointer
- option (variable length, defined by RFC 854 and 1323, use to negotiate MSS,
  define window scaling factor, time-stamping etc)

To improve the performance, the overhead of the connection tunnel must be
addressed. This could be done by [Windowing](202304261406.md). Usually, the
timeout will be doubled to act as a limited congestion control. It will be
[calculated](202303292133.md) once again when the timer is started after data is
received from the application above or the acknowledgement is received. With
these being implemented, however, the timeout can still be relatively long due
to the sender delay to resend the lost packet which also increase the end-to-end
delay. To address this issue, there is a policy defined in RFC 1122 and 2581 to
send duplicated ACKs (3 ACKs) according to different scenarios ([fast retransmission](202304211524.md)).
The following table summaries the policy decisions based on the RFCs proposed:

| Scenario                                                                                                                             | Reaction                                                                                                                           |
| ---                                                                                                                                  | ---                                                                                                                                |
| In-order segment with expected sequence number arrived and all up to the expected sequence number of the packet already acknowledged | Delay the sending of ACK up to 500ms, if the next in-order packet doesn't arrive, send an ACK                                      |
| In-order segment with expected sequence number arrivied but there is one other in-order packet in waiting of ACK                     | Immediately send out an ACK with cumulative sequence number and the ACKs for those in-order arrived packets                        |
| Out-of-order segment with higher-than-expected sequence number arrived which introduces a gap                                        | Immediately send out duplicate ACK that indicates the sequence number of the next expected byte, which is the lower end of the gap |
| Segment arrived partially or completely fills the gap in the received data                                                           | Immediately send out ACK where the sequence number starts at the lower end of the gap                                              |

From the descriptions above, we can see that TCP is a hybrid implementation of
[Go-Back-N (GBN) Protocol](202303141912.md) and [Selective Repeat (SR) Protocol](202303211253.md).
Similar to GBN, the ACK is cumulative, the correctly received but out-of-order
segments will not be individually acknowledged, and the sender maintains only
the smallest sequence number of transmission but doesn't acknowledge and the
next sequence number (?). TCP also inherits the properties from SR where the
buffer correctly receives but out-of-order segments, doesn't retransmit segment
if the ACK for another segment with the higher sequence number than the former
arrived before its timeout, and receive the ACK out-of-order segment
selectively (RFC 2018).

When facing [Network Congestion](202209302043.md), there is a throttling
mechanism that limit the transmission rate to save bandwidth. It is one of the
reason real time communication always perform badly in TCP especially when there
is not enough bandwidth available. Since [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md)
doesn't provide any feedback on the congestion situation, TCP have to take the
[End-to-End Congestion Control](202304261438.md) approach, and scale down the
window size upon detected packet loss in order to reduce the sending rate
computed by [TCP Reno Algorithm](202305031946.md). It is fundamentally a
self-clocking mechanism in which TCP utilises ACKs to trigger the increase of
congestion window size. There is a proposal, that is [TCP Vegas Algorithm](202305031935.md)
suggests the use of increasing of round-trip delay as an indicator in its
congestion control mechanism.
