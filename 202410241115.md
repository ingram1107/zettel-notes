# Linux User's Home Directory Skeleton

We can define a user's home directory skeleton through the template defined in
`$SKEL` (the directory to be referred, defined in `/etc/adduser.conf` or
`/etc/default/useradd`). The template will define the layout of the file system
structure for user's home directory if it is created through the command
`adduser` or `useradd`. By default, `$SKEL` is defined as `/etc/skel/`.
