# TCP CUBIC Algorithm

CUBIC is a [TCP Congestion Control](202503182241.md) #algorithm that is
designed for high bandwidth application. [Linux](202204081225.md) set CUBIC as
the default congestion control algorithm as checked in version 6.13.8. This can
be checked by the command `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_congeston_control`. (The
congestion control algorithm set is applied to [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md)
too)
