# AWS Pricing Model

AWS charges the computation power used in the unit of per hour or second. The
price is varied by the instance type chose by the customer. Storage is charged
typically per GB, same as the outbound data transfer (shown in *AWS Data
Transfer Out*). In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or
data transfer between other AWS services within the same [AWS Region](202312011406.md).

Generally speaking, you are paying for what you use, pay less when you reserve
(**All Upfront Reserved Instance, AURI**, Partial Upfront Reserved Instance,
**PURI**, **No Upfront Reserved Instance, NURI**), pay less when you use more,
and pay even less as AWS grows.

**Note**: Custom pricing for large volume is available if there's no suitable
pricing model for you to choose from.

Some AWS services offer no charge unless in some cases use in conjunction with
other AWS services that utilises these services. They are [AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](202401042139.md),
