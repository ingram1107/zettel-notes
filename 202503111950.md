# GTK `Variant`

`Variant` is typically used on data to be serialised (to another process, over
network, or store in disk) in [`gtk-rust`](202503111818.md). In addition to
[C](202302190647.md) primitives, it supports the conversion of other types like
`VariantDict`, `HashMap`, `Vec`, `Option`, tuple up to 16 elements, `Variant`,
and other compatible Rust `struct`s (where their members that can be
represented by `Variant`).

The syntax to use and initialise `Variant` is almost identical to [GTK Value](202503111943.md),
but instead of calling `to_value()`, the method `to_variant()` is called
instead.
