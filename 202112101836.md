# Queue

Queue is a kind of data structure that insertions done at one end, deletions
done at the other end. It is **FIFO** by design which is in contrast with
[202112031157](202112031157.md). It could be implemented in
[array](202112101848.md)#.

Queue can be used for:
- printer job queue
- file server
