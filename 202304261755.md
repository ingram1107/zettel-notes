# Network-Assisted Congestion Control

Network-assisted congestion control is a [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
method relying on the feedback of current congestion state from the network to
the source. The state may be illustrated by a single warning bit piggybacked on
an ACK packet or complex information like the transmission rate on the outgoing
link that the affected [Router](202207061800.md) can support. There are two
implementations of the feedback: direct feedback and network feedback. In direct
feedback mechanism, the router will send a choke packet (like
[ICMP](202209270927.md) Source Quench Packet) to the source to indicate a
congestion occurrence. In network feedback, the router instead merely marks the
packet field to indicate that a congestion is happening. Once the packet reach
the destination, the received host will notify the source host, which ultimately
take a [Round-Trip Time (RTT)](202303292133.md).

**Note**: To increase the efficiency for long distance, direct feedback can send
the choke packet hop-by-hop in which each intermediate node will reduce its
transmission rate accordingly.

Several network implementations such as IBM SNA, DECnet, and
[ATM Available Bit-Rate (ABR)](202305031337.md) adopt network-assisted
congestion control. There is a proposal (RFC 2481) to implement this method of
congestion control in [Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md)
network.
