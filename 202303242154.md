# System Architecture

System [Architecture](202304201731.md) defines the [System's](202303242148.md)
high-level structure which exposes its overall organisation as a collection of
[interacting](202303242118.md) components. It translates the logical design of
the information system into a physical structure, including #hardware,
#software, #networking, processing methods, and #security. Elements of system
architecture includes [components](202303250940.md),
[connectors](202303250943.md), [Systems](202303242148.md),
[properties](202303250953.md), [constraints](202303250956.md), and
[styles](202303250958.md). The ultimate aim of the system architecture is to
satisfy the [Requirements](202303251303.md) and prepare for easy modification or
tweaking to meet potential new requirements in the future. Most system
architecture are designed with [Architecture Description Language (ADL)](202303242159.md)
to have a planned, formal, and generic architecture design.

Depending on the task distribution, we can roughly categorise system
architecture into the following groups:
- [Mainframe Architecture](202304202043.md)
- [Stand-alone Computing](202304202047.md)
- [Client-Server Architecture](202304202049.md)
- [Internet-based Architecture](202304211051.md)
- [Cloud Computing](202210012158.md)
- [E-Commerce Architecture](202304211145.md)
- [Virtual Desktop Architecture](202304211604.md)
