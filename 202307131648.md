# POSIX

**Note**: From version 2024 onwards, POSIX C requirement follows what the latest
C version required by major toolchains. Currently, C17 is required.

POSIX standard mainly includes four sections: **XBD** (base definition on files,
[Regular Expression](202410061901.md) etc.), **XSH** (system interfaces,
[C](202302190647.md) API on POSIX internals), **XCV** (shell command language,
standard system utilities), and **XRAT** (authors' rationale).

Implementation wise, POSIX API must be at least
[kernel-persistent](202307131645.md), but
[filesystem-persistent](202307131657.md) is also probable by mapped files.

- [POSIX Mandatory Lock](202210262144.md)
- [Signal Handling In POSIX](202211022139.md)
- [Pthread](202207171457.md)
- [POSIX IPC](202308162223.md)

Before version 2024, there were issues on handling filenames especially those
that were with the newline character (`\n`). It is due to the fact that
filenames are simply treated as a string, without terminated by a NUL (`\0`)
character. Although there are existing solutions to this problem, POSIX aims to
simplify such solution such that input and output handling that involves
filenames can be more intuitive. The committee added an option for commands
(`find -print0`, `xargs -0`, `read -d ' '`) to accept NUL as delimiter.
Furthermore, many system utilities will output errors if the filename contains
newline character.
