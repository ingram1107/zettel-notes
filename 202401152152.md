# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that deploy codes on schedule or in
response to an event. This means that the underlying infrastructure is
automatically managed by AWS. Complement with AWS Step Function, we can
orchestrate multiple functions for complex tasks by building workflows. The
billing is only done on the compute time that the customer consumes when the
Lambda function has run.

Lambda relies on the event resource for the trigger, and may get the event from
[publisher](202207041109.md) ([S3](202312132008.md), Simple Notification System,
[CloudWatch](202401271302.md)), via polling (Simple Queue Service, [Amazon DynamoDB](202401250555.md)),
or be invoked directly ([AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)](202401270917.md)).
The function can also be invoked directly with the Lambda console, Lambda API,
AWS SDK, AWS CLI, and AWS toolkits.

To define an AWS Lambda function, we have to specify the runtime environment it
is going to run on, [execution role](202312131707.md), trigger, function code,
memory expected to be consumed, and optional specify environment variables. The
function is packaged as Lambda deployment package (ZIP format) which contains
the layer (dependencies) and function code, and is limited with the size of 250
MB. If it is a container image, then this limit is increased to 10 GB.

All requests done by the Lambda function are logged using Amazon CloudWatch.
