# Bash Alias

Single quotation allows dynamic expansion including those of [Bash Special Syntax](202410090816.md),
in contrast to how it functions alongside with [Bash Variable](202410241136.md).
Double quotation only allows static expansion, so no variable expansion should
be expected.

In the case where an alias share the same name to a command, `\` is used to
reach the command instead of the alias.
