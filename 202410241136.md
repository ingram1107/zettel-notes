# Bash Variable

In variable declaration, double quotation on the right side (value) allows
**value substitution** to be done. Single quotation on the value will retain the
**literal** characters within the quote instead, ignoring any possible
substitution. Double quotation used on the variable itself can retain the spaces
defined in the variable.

Bash provides the qualifier `readonly` for immutability on variable's value.

To define a **global variable** within bash environment, we must declare
`export` or `declare -x` before the variable name. Commands like `env` (lists
global variables) and `printenv` (lists value) can be used to check on global
variables. `env -i` can be used to erase most global variables that sustain a
minimal [Bash Environment](202410241038.md).

Global variable is not the same with [Bash Environment Variables](202410241124.md).
For it to be used as an environment variable, `env` shall be used on the
variable before running a command. `env` can be omitted though, with the
variable defined just before running the command.
