# Stop-and-Wait Protocol

Stop-and-wait protocol is a kind of [Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol](202303141902.md)
that will not proceed to next state unless the ACK or NAK for the previously
transmitted packet has been received. Thus, it will not get more data from the
upper layer while waiting for ACK and NAK. Theoretically, its ACK and NAK
packets don't need sequence number to function properly, though the sequence
number must be implemented if NAK is achieved through duplicate ACK for the
sender to differentiate between ACK packets.

Despite its simplicity, stop-and-wait protocol suffers significant drawback on
network bandwidth utilisation as it can only send one packet for a period of
time. Let $L$ as the packet size and $R$ as transmission rate, we know that for
an ACK packet to arrive to the source is $t = \text{RTT} + L/R$ (the data packet
first must arrive the destination, then the ACK packet can be sent). Thus, we
can calculate the network utilisation of stop-and-wait protocol with the
following formulae:

$$
U_\text{send} = \frac{L/R}{\text{RTT} + L/R}
$$

**Note**: $L/R$ is the [Transmission Delay](202302161914.md).

The solution for this problem is to implement [Pipelining](202303141909.md).
