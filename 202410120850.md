# Rust Dynamically Sized Type (DST)

DSTs or unsized types are Rust types where their size can be only known in
runtime. We cannot initialise a DST type, instead we should use references such
as `&`, [Rust Box](202206221113.md), and [Rust RefCell](202206232210.md) which
will contain its memory address and length. Example of DSTs include `str` and
closure.

[Rust Trait](202204061235.md) is a DST type too. To refer it, use the following
syntax:

```rust
// with &
&dyn Trait

// with Box<>
Box<dyn Trait>

// with RC<>
Rc<dyn Trait>
```

Such reference to a trait is called a trait object. It is dynamically dispatched
which will incur runtime cost and prevent [inlining](202205171916.md).

To enable a function with [Generic](202410042122.md) parameter to return a DST
type, the specifier `?Sized` must be used.
