# Network Congestion

Network Congestion is networking condition which could happen when there are too
many sources **sending too much** data **too fast** for a network to handle.
Factors that could case it are exceeding packet arrival rate compare to the
outgoing link [capacity](202304191208.md), insufficient memory, bursty traffic,
slow traffic etc.

This phenomenon could be observed when there are packet losses due to [buffer overflow](202209302245.md)
at [Routers](202207061800.md) and increasing [end-to-end delays](202304111955.md)
due to [Queuing Delay](202302161904.md) in router buffers. Large queue delays is
expected when packet arrival rate is approaching link capacity.

This results in the unfairness and poor utilisation of [network resources](202304191208.md)
due to resources used by dropped packets before they were lost, necessary or
unnecessary [retransmissions](202206151232.md) (further wasting bandwidth,
decreasing [Throughput](202304111957.md)), and poor resource allocation at high
load. All the forwarded [transmission capacity](202304191208.md) from the
upstream links like routers are wasted if the packet was dropped in the end.

For solution, see [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md).
