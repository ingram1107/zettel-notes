# Reference Counting Pointer
  
`Rc<T>` is a kind of the #[Rust Smart Pointers](202111301656.md) that share the
ownership of the referred variable or object between multiple pointers. Each
time when the reference is "borrowed", it will increment the reference count
(using method `Rc::clone`), and if such count is down to 0, `Rc<T>` will be
[destroyed](202206221653.md)#. This is similar to #cpp `shared_ptr` with the
difference that it allows only reading due to its immutable nature.

**Note**: We can inspect the current reference count by printing the return
value from the class method `Rc::strong_count(&{Rc<T>})`.

If there is a case where ownership should be not owned by other, but sharing is
still necessary (to avoid [Reference Cycle](202206251349.md)#), use the method
`Rc::downgrade` to get a [Rust Weak Pointer](202206251329.md)#. We can track how
many `Weak<T>` are in the scope using `Rc::weak_count(&{Rc<T>})`. Unlike
`strong_count`, `Rc<T>` will be clean up regardless of the value of `weak_count`
since `Weak<T>` doesn't possess the ownership of the reference.

`Rc<T>` can't be used in a [multithreading environment](202207171457.md)# as it
doesn't implement the [Rust Trait](202204061235.md)# [Send](202207172159.md)#
and [Sync](202207172210.md)#.
