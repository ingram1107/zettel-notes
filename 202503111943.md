# GTK `Value`

`Value` in [`gtk-rust`](202503111818.md) interfaces with primitive
[C](202302190647.md) types and other GObjects.

To assign a `Value` to a variable, we first initialise
[Rust](202410042152.md) primitives, `String`, or GObject compatible types by
calling the function `to_value()` to convert Rust type into `Value`. We can
retrieve the value by calling `get::<T>()` and do error handling afterwards as
it could return a `None` value or `Err`.
