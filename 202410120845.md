# Rust Never Type

Rust never type is denoted with `!` which specifies that the function will never
return any value. Such function is often called **diverging function**. The
following shows an example of it:

```rust
fn print(s: &str) -> ! {
    println!(s);
}
```

Another property of never type is that is can be coerced into any other type,
which is great for `match` pattern in case of a mismatch.
