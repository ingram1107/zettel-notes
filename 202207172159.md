# Rust Send

Send is a #[202204061235](202204061235.md) that allows the ownership of implemented types to be transferred safely in a [multithreading environment](202207171457.md)#. Almost all Rust types are implemented with Send trait, except #[202206221720](202206221720.md), and if the user's custom type is composed of those types, then it will automatically have the Send trait. There is **no method** needed to be implemented in this trait.
