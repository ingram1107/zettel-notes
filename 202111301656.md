# Rust Smart Pointers

Rust standard library implements several smart pointers for better *resource
cleaned up* as they have implemented the [Drop](202206221653.md)#
[Trait](202204061235.md)#. If a reference go out of scope, depending on which
kind of smart pointer that it is using, either it will be automatically
destroyed or decrements the number of references that is pointing to the
referred variable or object. Unlike other programming languages, such rule can
be check in compile time if wanted.

All smart pointers have [Deref](202206221604.md)# trait implemented so that they
could be treated like any other reference type in Rust. Meaning, they can use
`*` and `&` without any significance of syntactic difference from references.

The following shows several smart pointer implementation available in Rust:
- [Rust Box](202206221113.md)#
- [Reference Counting Pointer](202206221720.md)# that allow multiple ownership
  of the same object
- [Rust RefCell](202206232210.md)# where the [Rust Borrowing Rule](202206241126.md)#
  is checked in runtime instead
- [Rust Weak Pointer](202206251329.md)# which doesn't possess variable's
  ownership.

**Note**: Except `Rc<T>`, all smart pointers will move the variable which cause
a *transfer of the ownership*.
