- # Thread Creation in Rust
  
  Thread creation in Rust could be done with `thread::spawn` function imported from the standard library `std::thread`. A closure, that includes statements needed to be executed, should be passed to the function. The function will return the type `JoinHandle`.
  
  ```rust
  let print_val = String::from("hi");
  let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
  println!("Message: {}", print_val);
  });
  ```
  
  **Note**: `move` is necessary in order to move the ownership of a variable from the outer scope to the thread scope. This will avoid [202112061109](202112061109.md)# as the thread created truly owns the variable passed into its scope.
  
  After the creation of thread, they will execute their body in arbitrary time. This means that the main thread could end first before the completion of execution of all threads and terminate all of them without waiting. To let the main thread waits for other threads, use the method `join` provided by the type `JoinHandle`.
  
  ```rust
  handle.join().unwrap();
  ```
