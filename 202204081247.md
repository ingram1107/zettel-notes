# Systemd

Systemd provides several unit types for different purposes, which include
`service` (active, can be initialised, interrupted, and reloaded), `socket`
([filesystem](202202060057.md) or network socket that corresponds to `service`
unit which is loaded upon request), `device` (associated with hardware device if
`udev` rule exists, can be used to resolve configuration dependencies), `mount`,
`automount` (associated with `mount` unit which is initialised when accessed),
`target` (`service` units group as a single unit), and `snapshot` (save state of
systemd).

Commonly used systemd commands (`systemctl`) include `start`, `stop`, `restart`,
`status`, `is-active` (0 as true, 1 as false), `enable`, `disable`,
`is-enabled`, `list-unit-files` (with `--type` option), and `list-units`
(active). To alternate between different `target`s, `systemctl isolate` can be
run, which bears similar behaviours with runlevels in
[SysVinit](202408291124.md), but be aware that it will disable services that are
not enabled in the new `target`. We can change the default running target by
either altering the kernel parameter `system.unit={}.target` (which can persist
by changing bootloader configuration) or via the command `systemctl set-default
{}.target` that change where the link `/etc/systemd/system/default.target`
points to.

**Note**: Systemd provides somewhat equivalent runlevel's alternative with
`target` units which are named `runlevel10.target` to `runlevel6.target`.

## Power Management

Unless there is another power manager installed (like `acpi`), systemd will take
the responsibility as the power manager for the device. Command such as
`suspend` and `hibernate` are provided for such purpose. Other actions can be
associated to those power events in `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` or
`/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/`.

## Drop-in Files

We could configure a service by using drop-in files in
`/etc/systemd/system/{service}.service.d/`.

## Cgroups

To view [control group](202204071051.md)# related information, use commands
`systemd-cgls` to show cgroups in tree hierarchy and `systemd-cgtop` to show
their current resource usage. Most of such information are stored in the
`system.slice` directory.

Except `Slice` option (to create a custom cgroup), all property related to
cgroups could be defined and altered by the command `systemctl set-property
{Option}`.
