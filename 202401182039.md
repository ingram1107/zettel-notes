# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

S3 provides object-level storage volume which stores data as objects within
resources or buckets. AWS guarantees 11 9s durability by redundantly storing
data across multiple AWS facilities within a region. It allows the size of 5 TB
for a single object. By default, data is not permitted to be shared publicly,
and there is an option for the customer to turn on [encryption](202209281121.md)
in transit and at rest (server-side encryption).

We can access to the bucket with path-style
(`s3.{region-code}.amazonaws.com/{bucket-name}`) or virtual hosted-style
(`{bucket-name}.s3-{region-code}.amazonaws.com`) URL.

**Note**: Bucket name must be unique across [AWS Region](202312011406.md) and
comply to the [Domain Name System (DNS)](202209300947.md) naming convention.

S3 offers different classes for various use cases, including Standard,
Standard-IA (Infrequent Access), One Zone-IA, Intelligent-Tiering,
[Glacier](202401182231.md), and Glacier Deep Archive. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
optimises cost by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective tier. All
storage classes except One Zone-IA store data in at least three
[availability zones](202312011406.md). One Zone-IA stores data in only one
availability zone.

**Note**: Defining lifecycle policy can help automate the lifecycle of data
stored in S3, reducing the overall cost.

Server-side encryption can be done with *Amazon S3-managed encryption keys
(SSE-S3)*, *customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)*, or *[AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](202312131944.md)*.
SSE-S3 uses [AES-256](202209012213.md) for the encryption.

Amazon charges on stored volumes by the GB per month metric, outbound traffic to
other regions, and HTTP PUT, COPY, POST, LIST, and GET requests.
