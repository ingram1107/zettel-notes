# Transequatorial Propagation (TEP)

Transequatorial propagation occurs during daytime on 2 m band over equatorial
regions and common in temperate latitude in early summer, late spring and lesser
temperature degree in early winter. Equatorial E-skip can be expected on most
day throughout the year for receiving stations located within Â±20 degrees of
geomagnetic equator and peaks around midday.

TEP covers communication ranges from 2500 km to 5000 km.
