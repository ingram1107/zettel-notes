# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a #[greedy algorithm](202204151143.md) to find the
#[shortest path](202204141149.md) for weighted graph.

First, select a vertex that has the smallest weight among other unknown vertices
(the weight for edges to all other vertices other than root could be declared as
*infinite* whereas the root vertex will have 0 weight) in the graph. Then, after
all the weight of the edges to its adjacent vertices are updated if they are
smaller than the current value, the shortest path between the vertex and its
adjacent vertices is declared as known. The same steps will proceed to all other
unknown vertices until all shortest path to the vertices are declared known.

Dijkstra's vertices only need to know where the connected interface, that is the
connected edge, that will lead to the destination. Each vertex store their own
knowledge on the path by determining the interface that leads to the
destination. The **shortest path** is known through the understanding of the
weight of edges or interfaces. This is especially useful in understanding
[Link-State Routing Protocol](202207070959.md).

## Analysis

- It will result in $\Theta(\vert E \vert + \vert V \vert^2)$ or simply
  $\Theta(\vert V \vert^2)$
- For sparse graph, we could use [Heap](202202062259.md) to increase the runtime
  to $O(\vert E \vert \log \vert V \vert)$ by using its DeleteMin after the
  smallest vertex has been found and DecreaseKey to decrease the distance of W
  to the distance of V + $c_{v,w}$ if the latter is smaller. This could be
  implemented in Paring Heap.
- By using Fibonacci Heap, it could result in $O(\vert E \vert + \vert V \log
  \vert V \vert)$.

## Attention

- It is not wise to use this algorithm to calculate the shortest path for a
  graph with [negative edge costs](202204201038.md)#.

## Implementation

```c
void Dijkstra(Table T)
{
  Vertex V, W;

  for (;;) {
    V = smallest unknown distance vertex; //
    if (V == NotAVertex)                  // Could be replaced by DeleteMin
      break;                              //

    T[V].Known = True;
    for each W adjacent to V
      if (!T[W].Known)
        if (T[V].Dist + Cvw < T[W].Dist) {  // Cvw: the weight for edge (v,w)
          // Update W
          Decrease(T[W].Dist to T[V].Dist + Cvw); // Could be replaced by DecreaseKey
          T[W].Path = V;
        }
  }
}
```
