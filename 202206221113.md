- # Rust Box
  
  `Box<T>` is a kind of #[Rust Smart Pointers](202111301656.md) implemented by
  Rust standard library which is actually a single element Tuple with
  [Deref](202206221604.md)# and [Drop](202206221653.md)
  [Trait](202204061235.md)#. It doesn't have performance overhead. It stores
  data on the [Heap](202202062259.md)# rather than on the
  [Stack](202112031157.md)#. We can directly print the value (if it is of simple
  type) just like other primitive types without dereferencing it. Comparing to
  normal references, box is pointing to a *copied value*.
  
  Boxes are often used to accommodate the following situations:
- The size of the type can't be known at compile time (*recursive type*) but at
  the same time it is required to have an exact size when used.
- Ensure that the ownership transfer doesn't result in an expensive copy
  especially if the data is large.
- To have a type that implements a particular [trait](202204061235.md)# rather
  than a specific type.
  
  For example, we can define a [List](202110191710.md)# as a recursive
  type using the Box:
  
  ```rust
  enum List {
        Cons(i32, Box<List>),
        Nil,
  }
  ```
  
  If the above doesn't utilise the Box, the Rust compiler will complain about
  that it doesn't know the exact size of the data structure. It does suggest us
  to make use of indirection, by changing the data structure to store the value
  indirectly by storing a pointer to the value instead of storing a value
  directly.
