- # Linux Memory Management
  
  The resource management for newly recreated child process by `fork` system call
  will be done in #[202203251058](202203251058.md). They will point to the same process structure
  that their parent is using. This is crucial for I/O instructions since copying
  the file contents into the child's memory space can be costly. If the child
  wants to modify the process structure, #[202204081225](202204081225.md) will then copy the
  process structure and other necessary system resources for it to prevent
  #[202112061109](202112061109.md).
  
  If one or more applications are using too much RAM, Out Of Memory (OOM) Killer
  will be summoned by the kernel in order to terminate those applications. This
  could be further fine tune by [202204071051](202204071051.md)# where we could set how much
  memory could one application used before it terminated by OOM Killer.
  
  For virtual memory, #[202204081225](202204081225.md) can use either a file or dedicated partition for the
  paging in or out. The file or the partition are usually named as a swap.
