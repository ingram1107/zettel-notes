# Bash Environment

Bash has several system-wide and local files for environment set-up including
files defined as profile (`/etc/profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`,
`~/.profile`), as `bashrc` (`/etc/bash.bashrc`, `~/.bashrc`), and
`~/.bash_logout` for clean-up operations especially during remote session.

Bash shell provides a dozen of flags to customise the running environment,
including `-l` or `--login` (enter login mode), `-i` (interactive),
`--noprofile`, `--norc`, and `--rcfile` (specify an RC file for configuration).

The file `/etc/profile` will source `/etc/bash.bashrc`, and scripts defined in
the directory `/etc/profile.d` upon system's shell initialisation. When login
process is running, `~/.bash_profile` will take precedence over `~/.bash_login`
and `~/.profile` (this has the last priority). `~/.profile` is responsible to
check whether Bash shell is running and source `~/.bashrc` if so. Variable such
as `$PATH` and `$PS1` are set in `~/.profile`.

`/etc/bash.bashrc` makes sure that Bash is running in interactive mode, checking
the window size after command (`$LINES` and `$COLUMNS`), and setting other
variables. User's local `~/.bashrc` usually set history variables and source
`~/.bash_aliases` if there is any. Note that `~/.bashrc` is read when the
standard input is a network connection.
