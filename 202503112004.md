# GTK Signal

[GTK](202503111818.md) [Signal](202211022108.md) requires `'static`
lifetimes. To do that, we can utilise `std::sync::OnceLock`'s method
`get_or_init()` to ensure such signal is only initialised once. The following
codes show how to implement custom signal to a GObject:

```rust
impl ObjectImpl for CustomButton {
    fn signals() -> &'static [Signal] {
        static SIGNALS: OnceLock<Vec<Signal>> = OnceLock::new();
        SIGNALS.get_or_init(|| {
            vec![Signal::builder("divide-by-zero")
                .param_types([i32::static_type()])
                .build()]
        })
    }
}
```

There are signals defined by GTK library that can be accessed via methods with
the prefix `connect_`. To connect custom signal, we should use
`connect_closure()` and `glib::closure_local!` macro. The latter is needed to
run a closure in a single thread. It accepts strong (`#[strong]`) and
weak references (`#[weak]`, see [GTK Memory Management](202503112005.md)), plus
`#[watch]` attribute that disconnects the closure once the watched object is
dropped.

To call signal by name, we should utilise the method `emit_by_name()`.
