# Radio Horizon

Radio horizon is a function of altitude of the antenna above ground, the effects
of earth curvature, atmospheric conditions, and other interferences. It can be
expressed as the following formulae:

$$
\text{horkm} = 3.57 \times \sqrt{\text{hm}}
$$

Where:
- $\text{horkm}$ is in kilometre
- $\text{hm}$ is the height above ground, measured in metre
