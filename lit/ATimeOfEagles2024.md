# Infantry and Their Tactics

The presenter rejects simplistic view of French army during Revolutionary period
to be only capable of performing column tactic. Thus, concluding that French
army can only win through shear brute force.

Before *flintlock*, firearms were slow and unreliable. They are unable to do
shock actions and vulnerable to calvary shocks. This is the reason pike and
shock formation was prevalent during early modern era. After the invention of
*plug bayonet* and later *socket bayonet*, pike was made redundant. In French,
the amount of deployed French pikemen was first halved, then reduced to 1/3
proportional to the army size in 1651, to 1/4 in 1677, to 1/5 in 1688. Pikemen
were finally dismissed in 1703.

The advancement of firearms leads to two developments:
1. A **single, uniform** type of line infantry equipment which greatly simplify
   the order of battle, and
2. Infantries can fight in both **fire and shock actions**.

Despite its promising feature, due to the limited range, slow firing rate, and
ineffectiveness, fire action can't be the deciding factor to conclude a battle.
This rose the debates around whether line formation (in three-rank, fire
optimised) or column formation (shock optimised) is suitable in the battlefield.
For most European countries, line formation was preferred. To overcome its
weaknesses, they were covered by anchoring the flanks to impassible obstacles.

In France during the ancien régime, however, there were prominent military
theorists like *de Folard* and *Saxe* dislike line formation and mistrust the
effectiveness of fire action. Saxe even said that fire action produced more
noise than damage and advocated reversing socket bayonet and returning of plug
socket. Comparing to Saxe, de Folard was more cautious, and stated that fire
action prolonged the battle which causes more casualties. Ultimately, de Folard
claimed, it is the shock action that decided the result of a battle. De Folard,
however, suggested a radical solution of reintroducing pike into infantry
formation.

As the most prominent military leader during his period, Frederick the Great
from Prussia stated in his Military Testament of 1768 that the infantry firing
more rapidly will undoubtedly defeat the infantry firing more slowly. He was
obviously advocating for line formation and endorsed fire action. Thanks to
rigorous training, Prussian infantries were able to fire 5 rounds/minute in
ideal situation or 3 rounds/minute if conservatively assumed. Another
contribution from Frederick the Great was his reintroduction of infantry
manoeuvrability to the battlefield by organising Prussian battalions into
platoons.

**Note**: Iron ramrod was used to prevent firearm breaking during reloading.

After Seven Years War, both Spain and Russia introduced Prussian drill into
their infantry training. Austria followed suit by adopting Paun's regulation
1769 which was a copy of its Prussian counterpart.
