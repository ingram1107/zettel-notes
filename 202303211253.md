# Selective Repeat (SR) Protocol

SR protocol is a kind of [Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol](202303141902.md)
based on [Go-Back-N (GBN) Protocol](202303141912.md) (with window size) that
allows out-of-order arrival. Both sender and receiver has the same window size
of $N$. The window size must be less than or equal to the half of the size of
sequence number space for SR protocol, otherwise the protocol can't distinguish
retransmitted packets and later comer.

The out-of-order arrival is allowed as each packet keeps their own individual
logical [Timer](202404061106.md) (which can be calculated by a single #hardware
timer) at the sender side. Those out-of-order packets will be buffered until the
lowest sequence number packet are received from the sender. When the packets
arrived at the receiver side, it delivers all acknowledged packets together to
the upper layer. The window will then be moved according to the number of
packets delivered to the upper layer. On the sender side, the window will move
to the next unacknowledged packet with the smallest sequence number if the
packet which its sequence number is equal to the window base (first) sequence
number has received its ACK.

Receiver re-acknowledges received packets that of with sequence number below the
current window position to avoid retransmission. This is necessary as SR sender
and SR receiver lacks synchronisation mechanism, as their windows are not
necessarily identical.
