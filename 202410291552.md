# Earth-Moon-Earth (EME)

EME or moonbounce [communication](202408231247.md) utilises characteristics of
frequencies from VHF and above where they can escape the Earth's atmosphere and
get reflected from the moon. However, due to the long distance between the moon
and Earth, which will result in signal loss along the paths. To compensate such
loss, a high gain antenna, such as the one with a gain of 21.0 dBi at 144MHz,
can be used for CW EME work. Additional solutions including using high
transmission power and high gain antennas steerable in azimuth and elevation and
on the receiver end, deploying low noise pre-amplifiers and a high stability
receiver.

JT digital mode allows smaller station to initiate EME communication due to its
high sensitivity on inaudible noise. With the right amount of effective
isotropic radiated power (EIRP), SSB can also be used for EME communication.
