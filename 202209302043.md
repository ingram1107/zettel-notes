# Network Congestion

Network Congestion is networking condition which could happen when there are too
many sources **sending too much** data **too fast** for a network to handle.
Factors that could case it are exceeding packet arrival rate compare to the
outgoing link [capacity](202304191208.md), insufficient memory, bursty traffic,
slow traffic etc. This phenomenon could be observed when there are packet losses
due to [buffer overflow](202209302245.md) at [Routers](202207061800.md) and
increasing [end-to-end delays](202304111955.md) due to [Queuing Delay](202302161904.md)
in router buffers. The result is the unfairness and poor utilisation of
[network resources](202304191208.md) due to resources used by dropped packets
before they were lost, necessary or unnecessary
[retransmissions](202206151232.md), and poor resource allocation at high load.
All the forwarded [transmission capacity](202304191208.md) from the upstream
links like routers are wasted if the packet was dropped in the end.
