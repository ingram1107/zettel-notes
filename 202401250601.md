# Amazon Redshift

Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse that allows analysis on large
amount of data by [Structured Query Language (SQL)](202302231241.md) and
business intelligence (BI) tools. [Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)](202401290857.md)
and [Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)](202401290855.md) is supported. It
utilises leader node for task distributing and dense compute nodes for massive
parallel data processing.

Leader node manages communication with client programs and compute nodes. It
parses and develops plans to carry out database operations, then compiles code
for individual elements of the plan and assigns the code to individual compute
nodes. The compute note run the compiled code and send the intermediate results
back to the leader node for final aggregation.
