# User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

UDP is a widely used #[Transport Layer](202206131837.md)
[Protocol](202209302229.md)# (defined by #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md)
for the #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md).
Unlike [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md), it is an
unreliable and connectionless protocol that doesn't have [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
which is great for real time communication such as [voice chat](202303201850.md)
or [video streaming](202302201418.md). UDP doesn't guarantee that the packets or
datagram (its [Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)) will reach their
destination or arrive in order as there is no mean to maintain the connection
state (receive and send buffer, congestion control parameters, and sequence and
acknowledgement numbers parameters). If the receiver buffer is overflowed by the
traffic, UDP will simply drop the incoming packets. It has a rather small
segment headers, with only 8 bytes, and provides fine application control over
data transmission, which allow application-specific error recovery at
[Application Layer](202206131856.md) for reliability.

**Note**: Due to UDP lack of congestion control mechanism, it will pump at a
constant rate, which could overcrowd TCP traffics and force the latter to drop
their sending rates. This is a great problem in dealing [Networking Fairness](202306300825.md).

In case there is an unmatched UDP packet, that is, no [sockets](202202172152.md)
on the server side can match the packet's port number and/or [IP Address](202206281021.md),
the server will send a special [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md)
datagram to the source.

The structures of the UDP includes the following fields, each occupies 2 bytes:
- source [port number](202206151841.md)
- destination port number
- packet length
- checksum

The checksum is done in 1's complement (0 to 1 and 1 to 0) for each 16-bit data.
If the checksum is all 1s, then there are no errors. Otherwise, depending on the
application, the packet can be discarded or passed to the application with
warning.

`traceroute` utilises UDP for displaying possible routes and transit delays by
sending UDP against the destination port.

Examples of UDP:
- [Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)](202210221318.md)#
- [Network File System (NFS)](202302131659.md)
- [Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)](202303021112.md)
