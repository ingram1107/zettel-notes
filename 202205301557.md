- # Printing in Linux
  
  #[202204081225](202204081225.md) uses several unique *print queues* that can hold dozens of
  files waited to be printed. The files could be submitted by the program `lpr`
  which typically found in the directory `/var/spool/cups`. Print Queues are
  managed by [202205301742](202205301742.md)# (newer system that replaces LPD and LPRng) which
  will in turn sends them to the printers.
  
  Some printer especially high-priced one uses PostScript (PS) as a standard. By
  this sense, there will be no additional requirements to setup. However, if the
  printer is low- or mid-priced, it is highly possible that it doesn't support PS.
  Install [202205301606](202205301606.md)# into the machine and use it as the intermediary
  between workstation or computers to the printer(s).
