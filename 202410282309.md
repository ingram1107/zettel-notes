# Auroral Propagation

Auroral propagation relies on auroras to produce upper atmosphere ionisation for
[DXing on VHF and UHF Spectrum](202410281834.md). Voice modulated radio signals
may be used sometimes as ionisation persist longer than
[meteor](202410282304.md). However, ionised gas constantly moves, which leads to
heavy signal distortion. For example, on 2 m band, the voice is usually
unintelligible, but on 6 m band, the voice is more readable. Lower frequency
band is more preferable for auroral propagation.
