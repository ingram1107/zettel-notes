# Islamic Golden Age

In Islamic Golden Age, scientific and cultural exchanges across Muslim's regimes
after the fall of [Umayyad Caliphate](202302241657.md) flourished, resulting in
several scientific discoveries. The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement during
the reign of [Abbasid Caliph](202302271620.md) al-Mansur (754 â€“ 775) laid the foundation of later
innovations based on Greek scientific achievements. The House of Wisdom (Bayt
al-Hikma) in Baghdad was built by the Caliph Harun ar-Rasyid, which later
opened to scholarship during and after the reign of his son al-Ma'mun. First
observatory in the Islamic world was built during the reign of al-Ma'mun.

Astronomy and mathematical knowledges were mostly imported from Indian
civilisations.

After the first astrolabes in the Islamic world was built by [Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Fazari](202501072333.md),
the refinement and perfection of it became the focus of astronomers.
