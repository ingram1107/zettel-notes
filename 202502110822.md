# Experimental Congestion Control Protocol (XCP)

XCP is a [Network-Assisted Congestion Control](202304261755.md) protocol
proposed by Katabi et al. (2002). [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
is done at the receiver side by putting the computed feedback in the packet
header and then transmit to the sender. The sender then adjust its transmission
rate accordingly.
