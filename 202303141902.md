# Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol

ARQ protocol is a kind of [Protocol](202209302229.md) which provides reliable
data transmission service in addition of retransmission in case of data
corruption with **positive acknowledgement (ACK)** and **negative
acknowledgement (NAK)**. ACK is used to confirmed that a packet is received in
unaltered form, otherwise an NAK will be sent. It provides services like error
detection, receiver feedback (ACK and NAK), and retransmission.

**Note**: The NAK can be implemented as duplicated ACKs by resending the last
successful received packet.

In anticipation of ACK corruption, a **sequence number** should be assigned to
each packet to know which one requires retransmission. Other solutions such as
checksum bit(s) for ACK or retransmission can be considered, but the latter will
cause duplicate packets which must be handled. With sequence number, ARQ can
receive out-of-order packets and send out the appropriate ACK packet.

Packet loss is expected when packet transmit over lossy channel. To handle it,
ACK packet should be assigned with sequence number, and resent the last
successful received packet when packet is suspected to have been loss (duplicate
ACKs). There are various approach on packet loss detection, one of them utilises
[timer](202411082002.md).

Examples of ARQ protocol are:
- [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
- [Go-Back-N (GBN) Protocol](202303141912.md)
- [Selective Repeat (SR) Protocol](202303211253.md)
- [Stop-and-Wait Protocol](202411081932.md)
