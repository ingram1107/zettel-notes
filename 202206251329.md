# Rust Weak Pointer

`Weak<T>` is a kind of #[202111301656](202111301656.md) that doesn't possess ownership of a variable or an object and avoid [202206251349](202206251349.md)# that could be created from #[202206232210](202206232210.md) (especially `RefCell<Rc<T>>`) by replacing #[202206221720](202206221720.md). It can be obtained from `Rc<T>` with the method `Rc::downgrade`. All `Weak<T>` will be clean up once they are out of scope, regardless of the value of `weak_count` (from `Rc<T>`).

To test the validity of `Weak<T>`, that is, whether it is pointing to a still alive variable, is to inspect the return value of the method `Weak::upgrade` (it returns `Option<Rc<T>>`) using `match`.
