# Shotgun Parsing

Shotgun parsing is a [programming antipattern](202207121011.md), defined by the
paper The Seven Turrets of Babel: A Taxonomy of LangSec Errors and How to
Expunge Them, where parsing and input-validating code is mixed with and spread
across processing code. This is done without doing any systematic justification,
which deprives the program of the ability to reject invalid input, making
program state hard to predict.
