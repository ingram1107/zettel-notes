- # Rust Sync
  
  Sync is a #[202204061235](202204061235.md) that allows the type to be referenced in a [multithreading environment](202207171457.md)#. Rust primitive types has this trait implemented by default, and same as [202207172159](202207172159.md), if the type is entirely composed of these types, then it will have this trait implicitly. Some types such as raw pointers, #[202206221720](202206221720.md) and `Cell<T>` related types (including #[202206232210](202206232210.md)) doesn't implement this trait.
