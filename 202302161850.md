# Satellite Radio Spectrum

Common satellites used for transmitting satellite radio spectrum are
*geostationary satellites* and *low-altitude satellites*. The former permanently
remains above the same spot on Earth, typically above 36,000 km, whereas the
latter orbits around the Earth instead. They are treated like an orbiting
[Repeater](202207051832.md). Most amateur satellites are in Low Earth Orbit
(LEO), about 700 km above the earth. Few of them are in High Elliptical Orbit
(HEO), about 50,000 km above.

Satellite communications, in [Amateur Radio](202408231247.md), are usually occur
on the bands of 2m VHF and 70cm UHF. The assigned mission control station
defines the mode or band used in the schedule via on-board software and
computers and is responsible for general housekeeping of satellite like
telemetry verification and satellite maintenance.

**Note**: The ham is advised to check the schedule published by the satellite's
operator to know its operated mode at particular time.
