# Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)

PMTUD is a technique used in networking to determine the maximum MTU along the
path, which is then used to avoid fragmentation. It is mostly use at the
endpoints in [IPv4](202206151453.md), and exclusively at the endpoints in
[IPv6](202206281129.md).

In IPv4 implementation, PMTUD is done by first setting Don't Fragment (DF) flag
in [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md). If a device resides on the path
has a lesser MTU size compare to the source's, it will send back an ICMP with
Fragmentation Needed (Type 3, Code 4) to the source, attached with its MTU. The
mentioned steps will be repeated until the maximum MTU along the path has been
figured out.

In IPv6 implementation, MTU at the source is assumed to be the same as the MTU
at the [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md). Note that there is no DF flag in
IPv6. Likewise, device with lesser MTU sends back ICMPv6 with the flag Packet
Too Big (Type 2) to the source, which also contains the device's MTU. The steps
will be repeated until the maximum MTU along the path has been determined.
