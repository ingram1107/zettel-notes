# X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)

XDMCP is a #[202206151238](202206151238.md) protocol that used by
#[202205051624](202205051624.md) that allow local or remote access to the X
server. The server itself will run on the *user side* whereas the client will
*run remotely* if it isn't a local machine.

We can choose the so-called [202205182153](202205182153.md)#, formally XDMCP
server, by changing the variable `DISPLAYMANAGER` defined in the directory
`/etc/sysconfig` or the SysV, Upstart or [Systemd](202204081247.md) script
([Debian](202210012324.md) and Arch). Depending on the [Linux](202204081225.md)
distro, this variable could be found and/or defined in the file `desktop`
([Fedora](202210012320.md)) or `displaymanager` ([openSUSE](202205192257.md)).
The variable can be either the executable file that start up the server (Fedora)
or the name of that server (openSUSE). These servers are listed below:
- [202205182224](202205182224.md)#
- [202205182244](202205182244.md)#
- [202205182247](202205182247.md)#
- [202205182251](202205182251.md)#

Upon local access, the server will run the X server directly in the local
machine. For remote access, it will instead use the XDMCP protocol to deliver to
GUI session to the client following the permission configured in the server
system. We need to run the command `xhost +{client}` on the server in order to
connect the specified client which later we will export the variable `DISPLAY`
to the client's shell as `{server}:0.0` to direct the GUI of program to the
server. Closing such connection can be done by running `xhost -{client}`.

Since XDMCP doesn't primarily concern with encryption of its protocol, this
could be a security risk. Therefore, instead of using `xhost`, one can utilise
the [202203221227](202203221227.md)# for XDMCP by using the option `-X` or `-Y`
(`-X` is arguably more secure except for Debian) or setting options in
[202205191924](202205191924.md)#. When using this method, it is not necessary to
change the setting on the [202205182153](202205182153.md)#.

The alternative to XDMCP model is [202205201001](202205201001.md)# where not
only #windows or #macos computer is able to connect to
[202204081225](202204081225.md) computer, but the reverse is also true.
