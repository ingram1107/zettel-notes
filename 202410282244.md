# Tropospheric Ducting

Tropospheric ducting is a phenomenon where radio signals bend in atmosphere's
tropospheric. It occurs due to temperature inversions at the height up to 3 km
above. The ducting effects allow VHF and UHF to travel hundreds and even
thousands of kilometres. Generally, SSB and CW operators are the first one to
notice the openings from tropospheric ducting.

To avoid losing the chance to finish the contact, especially during short band
openings, contacts are made using tropospheric ducting which usually only
involve a brief exchange of signal report and the amateur's grid square location
(Maidenheads Locator System).
