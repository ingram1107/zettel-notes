# GTK Property

Properties can be seen as a public API to GObjects state through functions like
getters and setters.

One can add properties to custom GObjects via `#[derive(Properties)]`. Then, we
have to define the `wrapper_type` as the custom GObjects. We can generate
getters and setters with the attribute `#[property(get, set)]`. The following
code shows an example on adding properties to a custom GObject:

```rust
#[derive(Properties, Default)]
#[properties(wrapper_type = super::CustomButton)]
pub struct CustomButton {
    #[property(get, set)]
    number: Cell<i32>,
}
```

**Note**: `glib::derive_properties` macro provides boilerplate generation on
property API for an GObject in `ObjectImpl` [Trait](202204061235.md).

Furthermore, we can connect a callback function to an event when property is
changed.

It is useful to custom GObjects when there is a need of *binding state* of
different GObjects and notify consumers whenever a *property value changes*.
Take note that sending a [GTK Signal](202503112004.md) upon each property
changes has *computational cost*.
