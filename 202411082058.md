# Rust Macro

[Rust](202410042152.md) provides four ways to declare a macro: [declarative macro](202411082112.md)
with `macro_rules!` and 3 procedural macros, that is, [custom `#[derive\]`](202411082132.md)
(on `struct` and `enum`), [attribute-like macro](202411082152.md), and
[function-like macro](202411082156.md). Note that procedural macros need their
**own special crate**, though the language development team promises to remove
such dependency in the future. For now, the following code is necessary in
`Cargo.toml` to use [Compiler](202302152015.md) API to read and manipulate Rust
code (`TokenStream`):

```toml
[lib]
pro-macro = true
```
