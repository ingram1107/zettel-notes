# Rust Newtype Pattern

Newtype pattern in Rust is defined as a **tuple** wraps around a type. Since the
compiler will optimise it during [compilation time](202302121739.md), such
indirection doesn't incur runtime performance penalty. Additionally, the
compiler will do the type-check for the newtype in contrast to type aliasing.

Newtype pattern allow non-local [Rust Trait](202204061235.md) or type to be
implemented locally. However, such pattern doesn't inherit the methods from the
inner type that it is holding. For that to happen, we may implement [Rust Deref](202206221604.md)
trait on the newtype for it to return the inner type.

In other cases, it is desirable to have a newtype pattern to not expose the
private method, and instead provides only the public API (the one that is
implemented via the newtype interface).
