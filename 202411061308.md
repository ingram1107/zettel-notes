# Anacron

Anacron, like [Cron](202411061138.md), is a [Linux](202204081225.md) tool to run
jobs periodically. Unlike cron, it doesn't rely on the localhost to be run
continuously. To do so, it checks when did the job run for the last time and
whether it hasn't been running for a specified time period. After executed the
job, it will assign a timestamp to the job so that it can check it next time.
