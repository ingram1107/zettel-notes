# Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is the use of computing resources, either #hardware or
#software, to provide service over a network that could scale in demand of the
customer, thus no compatibility issue on customer side and pay as you go. Most
of the cloud service providers are utilising [Data Center](202210012205.md)# and
[Software Defined Network (SDN)](202305152046.md).

A cloud has several characteristics such as **on-demand self-service**, **broad
network access**, **resource pooling**, **rapid elasticity**, **measured
service**, and **multitenancy** (shared with multiple tenants). Normally, it has
massive resources at their disposal in order to support multiple users
simultaneously in a ubiquitous way, assuming it has great Internet
accessibility. It should be able to self-heal in case of computing resources'
failures. It can be [deployed](202310311829.md) in various ways.

Although on-premises cloud (private cloud, build by the company itself) is still
an option, it is often scales badly to meet the business
[Requirement](202303251303.md). Regardless, [bandwidth](202304191208.md),
[Latency](202304111955.md), and downtime are concerns for its performance, and
its #security is based on adjacent users from different organisation
([attacker](202301021642.md) will attack the weakest point on the link) since
most cloud providers will put them on the same hardware. There is also a risk of
unauthorised access to users' data.

That being said, it might not be ideal when considering the cost of migrating
existing data or those resided from other cloud provider. Additionally, there
are some applications that are simply not suited for cloud computing since the
usage requires extensive requirement.

There are several forms of cloud computing available to the customers to choose
with variety of freedom over the underlying computing structure:
- [Software as a Service (SaaS)](202304161334.md)
- [Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](202310311819.md)
- [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](202310311815.md)
- Desktop as a Service (DaaS)
- Managed Software as a Service (MSaaS)
- Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS)
- Data Center as a Service (DCaaS)
- Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)
- Information Technology Management as a Service (ITMaaS)
- Data Storage as a Service (DaaS)
- Analytics as Service (AaaS, for big data analysis and mining)
- Security as a Service (SecaaS, provision of #security via cloud)
- Identity and Access Management as a Service (IAMaaS)
- Monitoring as a Service (MaaS)

Examples of cloud services are:
- Amazon's Elastic Computing (EC2)
- AT&T Synaptic Cloud
- Cisco's Unified Computing Service (UCS)
- Google Cloud
- HP CloudSystem
- IBM Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Oracle Cloud
- OpenStack
- Linode's Cloud

**Note**: Deploy [Top-Down Information Assurance Approach](202408231520.md) as
the sole information assurance strategy as information is subjected to laws and
regulations of company's headquarters and cloud provider(s).
