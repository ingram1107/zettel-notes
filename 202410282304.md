# Meteor Scatter

Meteor scatter, or burst communication, uses JT6M and FSK441 to transmit
high-speed burst of digital data off the meteors. It first sends a request for
contact, and if the request is successfully received then it replies with RST
and grid locator information. If failed, the request is transmitted until no
contact can be made. It has a similar communication range compare to [Sporadic E](202410282255.md).

Multiple contacts from multiple station can be made off the same meteor trail
depending on its intensity until the trail dissipates and can no longer reflect
VHF signals with the required minimum signal strength.
