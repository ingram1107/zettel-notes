# Hasan ibn al-Haytham

Al-Haytham was an astronomer and physicist during the [Islamic Golden Age](202501072311.md).
He is known as the Father of Modern Optics due to his work the Book of Optics
(Kitab al-Manazir), which laid the foundation of the field of optics. In the
book, he compiled the law of refraction discovered by [Abu Sad al-Ala ibn Sahl](202501081737.md)
and introduced the law of reflection. He was one of the proponents of
[Scientific Method](202501081701.md), and the first to understand the workings
of camera obscura. He also stated that the light always takes the easiest path,
which later inspired Fermat's principle.
