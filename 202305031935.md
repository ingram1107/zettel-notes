# TCP Vegas Algorithm

TCP Vegas is a [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
[network congestion algorithm](202304261438.md) that aims to maintain a good
[Throughput](202304111957.md) by observing [Round-Trip Time (RTT)](202303292133.md).
Because TCP's nature of using end-to-end congestion control, the packet loss
plays an important indicator on deciding how should a congestion control
#algorithm response. Instead of relying on notification of packet loss (timeout
or 3 [ACKs](202303141902.md)), it observes the RTT, so that if RTT is longer, it
is likely that the congestion is more severe in the routers along the path. By
adopting to this algorithm, TCP sender could detect congestion in advance before
indication of packet loss and decrease its sending rate linearly according to
the round-trip delay.
