# Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

DSL is a #[Broadband](202208311155.md) technology that provides high-speed
Internet via existing telephone cabling, i.e., [Twisted Pair Cable](202210111832.md),
similar to [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md), over a
[Local Loop](202304041948.md). It is generally referred to as xDSL due to
variety of existing flavours of DSL including *Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)* and
*Symmetric DSL (SDSL)*. The former offers faster download speeds than upload
speeds and is usually subscribed by casual Internet users. The latter offers
equal bandwidth in both directions, which is preferred in commercial settings.
The bandwidth is divided using [Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)](202209091327.md).

Either way, DSL is distance sensitive due to its inability to amplify the
signals and converted to other medium. It can reach a maximum distance of around
5.5 km.

Since human speech occupies frequencies of roughly 4kHz and the copper wires are
capable of carrying 1 to 2MHz, it is possible to crave out a portion of it for
the high-speed Internet connection provision. For upstream data, it will use up
around 26 to 160kHz, whereas the downstream data will use up around 240 to
1500kHz. However, due to the nature of twisted-pair wires used by the telephone
line, it is required by DSL to have specialised equipments such as **low-pass
filters (LPF)** and **DSL access multiplexers (DSLAM)** to prevent interference
between voice and data due to high frequencies. LPF is typically placed on all
phone jacks that are not used by a computer in order to prevent interference.
DSLAM functions as an aggregator for signals and acts as the access point to the
Internet. Another responsibility of DSLAM is the translation of digital signal
to analogue signal and vice versa. DSLAM modem is connected to multiple
households.

The performance of DSL can be affected by the distance between the household and
the central office (CO), the gauge of [Twisted Pair Cable](202210111832.md), and
the degree of electrical interference.

DSL has the following variants, all could be referred to as XDSL collectively:
- [Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)](202404070657.md) for residential customers
- Asymmetric DSL version 2 (ADSL2) for residential customers but 3 times faster
- Symmetric DSL (SDSL) for businesses with data exporting need
- High bit rate DSL (HDSL) for businesses up to 3 miles or 4.8 km away
- Very high bit rate DSL (VDSL) for businesses, provides up to 52 Mbps
