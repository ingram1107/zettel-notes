# TCP Splitting

[TCP](202206151232.md) splitting breaks the client's TCP connection at the
front-end server (which is most likely close to the client). This improves the
[Cloud](202210012158.md) performance by reducing the delay and
[RTT](202303292133.md) between each message.

A typical implementation of TCP splitting is to have the front-end server
initiates a persistent TCP connection, on behalf of the client, to the
[Data Centre](202210012205.md), which has a very large TCP congestion window.
The following formula shows the estimation on cloud delay:

$$
4 \times \text{RTT}_\text{FE} + \text{RTT}_\text{BE} + \text{processing delay}
$$

If the front-end server is close to the user, $\text{RTT}_\text{FE}$ is
negligible. Thus, the overall delay is roughly equal to $\text{RTT}$, assuming
that the value of $\text{RTT}_\text{BE}$ is approaching $\text{RTT}$.

Another benefits of deploying TCP splitting is that it reduces TCP
retransmission delays which is cased by losses in access network.

Most content distribution network (CDN) server performs TCP splitting to
improve their performance.
