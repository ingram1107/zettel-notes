# Nmap

Nmap can be used to scan port availability and pentest.

When scanning a remote port, if it receives SYN ACK packet (see [TCP Flow Control](202304231611.md)),
this indicates that the remote port is opened for connection. If an RST packet
is received, then the port is closed, though not block by the firewall. If Nmap
receives no response from the source, it implies that the firewall had blocked
the port scanning from the utility.
