# Building A GTK Application in Rust

Before building a UI, a GTK application builder (`Application::builder`) has to
be initialised by first specifying its app ID (typically its app name, the
format of `org.gtk_rs.{app_name}`), then calling `build()`. The UI can then be
attached to the built app via the method `connect_activate()`. We run the app by
calling the method `run()` on the built app.

Note that to display **multiple widgets at once**, a `gtk::Box` should be used
instead to contain them via the method `append()`. This is because `Window` can
only have one child (`child()`) at a time, on contrast to `gtk::Box` that can be
appended to have multiple subwidgets. We can then `present()` the `Window`.
