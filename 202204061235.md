# Rust Trait

Rust provides many default Trait ready to use. There are:
- [Rust Deref](202206221604.md)#
- [Rust Drop](202206221653.md)#
- [Rust Send](202207172159.md)#
- [Rust Sync](202207172210.md)#

Using *generic type parameter with trait bounds* could only able to define a
homogeneous container which is checked during compile time. The following
example shows how it looks like:

```rust
pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
  pub components: Vec<T>,
}

impl<T> Screen<T> where T: Draw {
  ...
}
```

If a `Screen` object created, its field `components` will contain a vector of
the type specified by the type parameter `T` and will be only able to store that
particular type. This limited the flexibility of Rust to include different types
that have the same trait.

One could use #[202206221113](202206221113.md) as in `Box<dyn Trait>` in order to have a container that could include
various types that share the same trait. For example:

```rust
pub struct Screen {
  pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}

pub struct Button {
  ...
}

impl Draw for Button {
  ...
}

pub struct SelectBox {
  ...
}

impl Draw for SelectBox {
  ...
}
```

By such, `Screen` will be able to hold a vector of `struct` that have the trait
`Draw`. This means that the vector could hold both `Button` and `SelectBox` at
the same time while still being able to be compiled. That being said, the
checking is moved to runtime which obviously will introduce some **overhead**.
