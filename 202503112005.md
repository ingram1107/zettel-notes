# GTK Memory Management

`glib` provides the macro `clone!` as a handy shorthand to Rust native `clone()`
method to avoid boilerplate. Within the macro, we can define whether the
variable should be borrowed as a strong reference or a weak reference (See
[Rust Smart Pointers](202111301656.md)) by specifying the attribute `#[strong]`
or `#[weak]` respectively.
