# Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation (RAII)

RAII is Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation. The resource hold by the object
is tie to the object's lifetime. It will prevent resource leaks. This could be
achieved by [C++ Rule of Thumbs](202202012316.md)#.

Access to the raw resources in the class, advised by [Meyer](lit/@Meyer2005.md),
should be done explicitly, that is, through `get()` function, as it is a safer
solution. That being said, if it is deemed inconvenience, operators `*`, `->`,
and `()` can be implemented to provide the access.
