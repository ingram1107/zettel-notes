# Rust Attribute-Like Macro

[Rust attribute-like macro](202411082058.md) is defined through
`#[proc_macro_attribute]` as a function with attribute and item as arguments
with the type of `TokenStream`, with a return type of `TokenStream`. The
following codes show an example of an attribute-like macro:

```rs
#[rout(GET, "/")]
fn index()
```

It works similarly to [Rust Custom `#[derive\]`](202411082132.md).
