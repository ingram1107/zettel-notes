# Systemd-Timer

Systemd-Timer can be used for [Linux](202204081225.md) job scheduling. We can do
periodic job execution within the `[Timer]` section with the following format
defined in a [`timer`](202204081247.md) file:

```systemd
[Timer]
OnCalendar=day-of-week year-month-day hour:minute:second
```

**Note**: It shares the same special characters with [Cron](202411061138.md),
with the exception: `-` is replaced by `..` to specify a range of value.

Systemd-Timer also provides several time specifications such as `hourly`,
`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, and `yearly`.

For the `timer` unit to be activated, one have to execute `systemctl
daemon-reload`.

To view all the `timer` units, we can execute the command `systemctl
list-timers`, or to show also those of inactive, with `--all` flag.
