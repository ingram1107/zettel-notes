# Vulkan

Vulkan is developed to suit the modern GPU architecture, where its older
counterparts like OpenGL and DirectX are lacking behind. This is done with more
verbose API, multiple command [Threads](202404131843.md), reduce of
inconsistencies in shading compilation, and unify graphics and computing
functionalities.

Vulkan provides validation layer to *check any misused parameter values*, *track
resource leaks*, *check thread safety* ([Race Condition](202112061109.md), data
corruption, or unexpected behaviour), *log function calls and their
parameter(s)*, and *trace for profiling and replaying*.
