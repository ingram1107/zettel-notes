# Ibn Sina

Ibn Sina, commonly known by his Latin name *Avicenna*, was a scientist in
[Islamic Golden Age](202501072311.md) who was one of the proponents of
[Scientific Method](202501081701.md). He was a supporter of John Philoponus's
theory of impetus, which stated that object in motion will be in motion unless
there is an external force.
