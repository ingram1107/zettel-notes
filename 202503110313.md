# C and C++ Atomic Operations

Atomic operations can prevent [Compiler](202302121739.md) from reordering the
code which could alter the program state. It has the following semantics:
* **Acquire**: No rearrangement after this, codes can be done after this.
* **Require**: Everything before this must be done
* **Full Fence**: Acquire + Release.
