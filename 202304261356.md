# SYN Flooding

SYN Flooding is a [Denial of Service (DoS)](202209262115.md) attacks aiming the
vulnerability of [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md) connect
management. Such attack can be countered by SYN cookies.

The defence mechanism against SYN flooding works, by careful crafting the
initial TCP sequence number at the server side. The sequence number is generated
by a [Hash Function](202112122038.md) on source and destination [IP Address](202206281021.md)
and port number of SYN segment and a secret number. The server then sends SYN
ACK with this sequence number. If the client is legitimate, then it will send
back an ACK packet with the sequence number incremented, which will be then
verified with the same hash function. After the verification, only then the
server creates a fully-open connection.

**Note**: Server doesn't remember the cookie or other state information from SYN
segment.
