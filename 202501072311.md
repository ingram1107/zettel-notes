# Islamic Golden Age

In Islamic Golden Age, scientific and cultural exchanges across Muslim's regimes
after the fall of [Umayyad Caliphate](202302241657.md) flourished, resulting in
several scientific discoveries. The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement during
the reign of [Abbasid Caliph](202302271620.md) al-Mansur (754 â€“ 775) laid the foundation of later
innovations based on Greek scientific achievements. The House of Wisdom (Bayt
al-Hikma) in Baghdad was built by the Caliph Harun ar-Rasyid, which later
opened to scholarship during and after the reign of his son al-Ma'mun. First
observatory in the Islamic world was built during the reign of al-Ma'mun.

Astronomy and mathematical knowledges were mostly imported from Indian
civilisations.

After the first astrolabes in the Islamic world was built by [Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Fazari](202501072333.md),
the refinement and perfection of it became the focus of Islamic astronomers.
Ptolemaic model was also under heavy scrutinies among the astronomers and
physicists. Islamic scholars also further developed and standardised spherical
trigonometry.

The following shows a list of prominent Islamic scientists that were well-verse
in variety of field:
- [Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Fazari](202501072333.md)
- [Ahmad ibn 'Abdallah al-Marwazi](202501072342.md)
- [Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi](202501072346.md)
- [al-Farghani](202501072353.md)
- [al-Battani](202501080023.md)
- [Abu Bakr al-Razi](202501081630.md)
- [al-Khujandi](202501081635.md)
- [Hasan ibn al-Haytham](202501081637.md)
- [Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni](202501081721.md)
- [Ibn Sina](202501081722.md)
- [Abu Sad al-Ala ibn Sahl](202501081737.md)
- [al-Sijzi](202501081755.md)
- [al-Farisi](202501081759.md)
- [al-Kindi](202501081802.md)
- [Nasir al-Din al-Tusi](202501081933.md)

The decline of Islamic Golden Age was slow and gradual, it ended after the
collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The curb of the development of [Scientific Method](202501081701.md)
came from powerful religious and political figures such as caliphs as it was
used by [Abu Bakr al-Razi](202501081630.md) to challenge the
[Authenticity](202210022151.md) of Hadith. The sack of Baghdad and the
destruction of the House of Wisdom also contributed to the decline due to loss
of centralised scholarship.
