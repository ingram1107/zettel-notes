# Process Niceness

[Linux](202204081225.md) defines nice value range from -20 to 19. Lower nice
value has higher priority. Those values that are of lower than 0 required root
permission to be set. Programs that can be used to interact with process
niceness are `nice -n {val}` (default value set as 10) and `renice {val}` with
`-p` (PID), `-u` (user), or `-g` (group) argument.

**Note**: `renice` can adjust niceness value relatively with `-n` since
[POSIX](202307131648.md) 2024.
