- # Mutex in Rust
  
  If there is a need to share the data across multiple #[threads](202207171541.md), [202112061109](202112061109.md)# will inevitably happen. The need for a mutex (mutual exclusion lock) arises, so that only the one that obtained the lock can modify the data state at a time, where others will queue up and wait for the lock to be released. Rust provides `Mutex` type through the standard library `std::sync::Mutex`. Acquiring the lock from `Mutex` can be done by simply calling the function `lock`. However, there is a need to handle the error that could arise if the current owner of the mutex panics during its execution.
  
  ```rust
  let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
  let mut handles = vec![];
  
  for _ in 1..10 {
  let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
  let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
  		let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
  		*num += 1;
  });
  }
  
  for handle in handles {
  handle.join().unwrap();
  }
  
  println!("counter: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());  // Outupt: counter: 10
  ```
  
  As you can see that, we wrap around the Mutex into another type, `Arc` (imported from `std::sync::Arc`). It allows the data to be shared across multiple threads without violating the rule of Rust ownership, that is, it is atomic. You can treat it as [202206221720](202206221720.md)# with the [202207172159](202207172159.md)# and [202207172210](202207172210.md)# [202204061235](202204061235.md)#.
  
  Further inspection into the code, we find out that Mutex offer interior mutability, and can be [202206221604](202206221604.md)# using the syntax `*`. It is essentially the same to the [202206232210](202206232210.md)#. Therefore, one advice is to treat Mutex as if it is a [202111301656](202111301656.md)# with [202207172210](202207172210.md)# [202204061235](202204061235.md)#.
