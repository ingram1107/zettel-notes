# TCP Reno Algorithm

TCP Reno is a [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
[congestion control algorithm](202304261438.md) by deciding the sending rate
at the sender side to reduce [Network Congestion](202209302043.md). There are
also variations of Reno RFC 3782 (New Reno) and RFC 2018.

The sending rate (bytes per second) is computed by the result from congestion
window divided by [Round-Trip Time (RTT)](202303292133.md). Congestion window
is a variable set at each end of the connection, initially as 1 
[Maximum Segment Size (MSS)](202303282019.md), in TCP that can be used to as a
constraint the sending rate of the sender to the network. Basically, the
unacknowledged number of data on the sender must not exceed the minimum value of
from both congestion window and receiver window. The following mathematical
notation clarifies the concept, note that it is similar to the sender side's
[flow control mechanism](202304231611.md):

$$
\begin{align}
\text{last byte sent} - \text{last byte acknoledged} &\le \text{min}(\text{congestion window}, \text{receiver window})\\
\text{sending rate} &= \frac{\text{congestion window}}{\text{round-trip time}}
\end{align}
$$

There are three main components in this congestion control #algorithm :
**additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)**, **slow start (SS)**, and
**reaction to timeout events**. Two kinds of loss event are defined by TCP, that
is timeout and 3 duplicated [ACKs](202303141902.md), which happened after a
packet was drop in the network. With AIMD, the sender will cautiously increase
the congestion window size by 1 MSS for each RTT when it received an ACK. This
linear increasing phase is also known as congestion avoidance phase. If triple
duplicated ACKs are received, the sender halves its congestion window size but
not below 1 MSS. The former mechanism is called additive-increase whereas the
latter is multiplicative-decrease. A common approach for the TCP sender to
increase its congestion window size by $\text{congestion window size} +
\text{MSS} \times (\text{MSS}/\text{congestion window size})$. If a timeout
event is detected instead, the congestion window drops to its initial value,
that is 1 MSS, and enter the slow start phase. This introduces another variable
called *threshold*, initialised as a large value (typically 65 Kbytes), that
depends on the halving of congestion window size by multiplicative-decrease.
Coming back to the SS phase, the sender will transmit at 1 MSS rate, but the
sending rate will exponentially according to the number of ACK, that is the
increase of 1 MSS rate for each acknowledged packet for each RTT, until a loss
event is detected. Either the sending rate has reached the threshold or 3
duplicated ACKs have been received (fast recovery), the sender ends its SS phase
and return to congestion avoidance phase.

**Note**: Loss events in congested router will affect all sources' congestion
window size along the path.
