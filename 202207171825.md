- # Rust Channel
  
  Since Rust uses the model of message passing (same as [202203021733](202203021733.md)) as a mean of thread synchronisation, a channel must be established for the threads to communicate with each other. The standard library `std::sync::mpsc` (`mpsc` stand for [multiple producer single consumer](202201301240.md)#) provides the function `mpsc::channel` that could create a channel, which will define **transmitter(s)** (the one that sends messages) and **receiver** (the one that receives messages). The return type will be a tuple, the first element represents transmitter(s), the second element represents receiver. Combining with #[202207171541](202207171541.md), we can send a message from a thread (via transmitter's method `send`) to the main thread (via receiver's method `recv` or `try_recv`).
  
  ```rust
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
  
  thread::spawn(move || {
  let message = String::from("hi");
  tx.send(message).unwrap();      // proper error handling irl
  });
  
  let received = rx.recv().unwrap();  // proper error handling irl
  println!("Got: {}", received);      // Output: Got: hi
  ```
  
  **Note**: If for some reason a receiver has been dropped, `send` will return an error. Handle it properly.
  
  **Note**: `recv` will block the main thread's execution until the message arrived. An error will return if all transmitters connected to the channel have been closed.
  
  **Note**: `try_recv` is like `recv` but without waiting. If it doesn't get the message at the time, it will simply return an error that need to either `unwrap` or handled properly. It will not block the execution of the main thread.
  
  We can share the channel created among multiple threads by cloning the transmitter.
  
  ```rust
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
  
  let tx1 = tx.clone();
  thread::spawn(move || {
  let message = String::from("hi");
  tx1.send(message).unwrap();      // proper error handling irl
  });
  
  let tx2 = tx.clone();
  thread::spawn(move || {
  let message = String::from("world");
  tx2.send(message).unwrap();      // proper error handling irl
  });
  
  
  for received in rx {
  println!("Got: {}", received);
  }
  ```
  
  Note that we can iterate through `rx`, the receiver, in a `for` loop in order to print out or obtain message(s) from multiple transmitters.
