# Scientific Method

Scientific method emphasises the need of experiments to testify the hypothesis
in order to produce a repeatable result. Such process is done
[iteratively](202305061342.md), start from making an observation, coming up with
an educational guess (i.e. hypothesis), and testing it with experiment.

It was pioneered by various [Islamic scientists](202501072311.md) during 10th
century. Those scientists were [Abu Bakr al-Razi](202501081630.md), [Hasan ibn al-Haytham](202501081637.md),
[Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni](202501081721.md), and [ibn Sina](202501081722.md).
