# DXing on VHF and UHF Spectrum

Although the range of VHF and UHF for [Amateur Radio](202408231247.md)
communication are limited by their line of sight (LoS) propagation or smaller
radio horizontal, their radio waves can get reflected by atmosphere and
sometimes result in distant contacts under certain conditions. There are several
propagation types for VHF and UHF frequency:
- [Tropospheric Ducting](202410282244.md)
- [Sporadic E](202410282255.md)
- [Transequatorial Propagation (TEP)](202410282258.md)
- [Meteor Scatter](202410282304.md)
- [Auroral Propagation](202410282309.md)

Most VHF and UHF use Carrier Wave (CW) and Single-Sideband Modulation (SSB) for
[DXing](202410281824.md) as they are suited for fading signals. Digital modes
like JT65 and PSK31 can be operated from PC, which are good for DXing due to the
deep searching DSP algorithm for weak signals (amplification?). The following
tables show the radio communication technology deployed by VHF and UHF for weak
signal activity, which are generally takes places on the lower portion of the
spectrum:

VHF Frequency     | Usage
---               | ---
144.000 – 144.035 | Exclusive [EME](202410291552.md) CW
144.035 – 144.100 | EME and Terrestrial Weak Signal CW
144.100 – 144.250 | EME and Terrestrial Weak Signal CW/SSB/Narrowband Data
144.250 – 145.000 | All Mode Simplex
144.390           | [Auto Packet Reporting System (APRS)](202410081132.md) Spot Frequency (AX.25 1200 bps)
144.489           | [Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR)](202410282202.md)

UHF Frequency     | Usage
---               | ---
430.000 – 430.500 | CW/Phone DX
430.500 – 430.700 | Narrowband Data
430.700 – 431.900 | Simplex, All Mode
431.900 – 432.240 | EME
432.240 – 434.000 | Simplex, All Mode

The most common antenna polarisation used on VHF and UHF DXing is **horizontal
polarity** as it is less prone to ground absorption especially for long distance
communication. Examples of the deployment of horizontal polarity are horizontal
loop, cubical quad fed at the horizontal side, and a yagi antenna with elements
mounted horizontally or parallel with the ground. **Vertical polarity** can be
the alternative when attempting to work distance repeaters or user who do not
have horizontally polarised antennas, and it is especially effective on
Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) communication. It has mechanical advantages on repeater
and mobile stations in obtaining omnidirectional signal. There are also ham that
utilise the antenna with dual polarity (like linear cross yagi) to take
advantage of both characteristics, though this requires special consideration to
be given to its feed points. Another approach on antenna polarisation is via
**circular polarity** which is commonly deployed for space communication where
signal coming earth-bound tend to be CW or anti-CW twisted due to Faraday and
Doppler effects. Helical antenna deploys this kind of polarisation.

To establish a communication channel, propagation beacons first observe band
openings and determine whether there is any path open for communication. If one
can receive the beacon successfully, due to reciprocity, a two-way contact
between stations is possible. Most beacons operate in CW mode with varying power
levels. They may operate for 24/7, with predefined schedule, or on random
intervals (with the help from [WSPRnet](202410282202.md)).
