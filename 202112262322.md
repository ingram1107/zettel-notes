# Barrier in Pthread

Barrier is a mechanism in Pthread to queue up a definite number of threads
before the execution of sequences of codes. It comes in handy when the order of
memory access is critical for the program especially if the main function is
depends on #[routines execution](202112061141.md) or routines are dependent of
each other.

To use a barrier, declare a `pthread_barrier_t` object and initialise it by
calling the function `pthread_barrier_init` and specify how many threads that
this barrier should wait for. After that, call `pthread_barrier_wait` to
activate the queue. At last, do not forget to clean up the barrier by calling
`pthread_barrier_destroy`.

```c
pthread_barrier_t barrier;

// in the program
pthread_barrier_init(&barrier, NULL, 5); // specify the number of threads that this barrier should wait

// at somewhere
pthread_barrier_wait(&barrier);

// at the end of the program
pthread_barrier_destroy(&barrier);
```

**Note**: This is much different to [202112061117](202112061117.md) since it
does not actually lock down a certain portion of codes.
