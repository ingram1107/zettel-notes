# System Architecture

System [Architecture](202304201731.md) defines the [System's](202303242148.md)
high-level structure which exposes its overall organisation as a collection of
[interacting](202303242118.md) components. It translates the logical design of
the information system into a physical structure, including #hardware,
#software, #networking, processing methods, and #security. Elements of system
architecture include [components](202303250940.md),
[connectors](202303250943.md), [Systems](202303242148.md),
[properties](202303250953.md), [constraints](202303250956.md), and
[styles](202303250958.md). The ultimate aim of the system architecture is to
satisfy the [Requirements](202303251303.md) and prepare for easy modification or
tweaking to meet potential new requirements in the future. Most system
architecture are designed with [Architecture Description Language (ADL)](202303242159.md)
to have a planned, formal, and generic architecture design.

A good system architecture will ease the possible [System Integration (SI)](202303242149.md)
and put them into operational state, thus saving significant costs like
maintenance and drastically increase the system flexibility.

Depending on the task distribution, we can roughly categorise system
architecture into the following groups:
- [Mainframe Architecture](202304202043.md)
- [Stand-alone Computing](202304202047.md)
- [Client-Server Architecture](202304202049.md)
- [Internet-based Architecture](202304211051.md)
- [Cloud Computing](202210012158.md)
- [E-Commerce Architecture](202304211145.md)
- [Virtual Desktop Architecture](202304211604.md)
