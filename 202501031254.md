# Commonality and Variability Analysis

Commonality and variability analysis is a [Software Development Practice](../202207121011.md)
that [factor out](../202206032059.md) the common parts between two functions to
define a *new function* to be called by them. In the case of class, the common
parts between classes are factored out to form a new class, where the original
classes access it through [Class Inheritance](../202302042023.md) or
[Object Composition](../202302051222.md). It is useful in [DRY Principle](../202206171004.md)
as it avoids code duplication.

In [C++](../202302190651.md), this analysis can be done easily on functions and
classes since the common parts are explicit. In the case of template, however,
those common parts can be implicit in the form of template parameters, both
non-typed and typed. [Meyers](@Meyer2005.md) suggests factoring out common
non-type parameter(s) out to form a derived class and hide the templatised
version from the public to ensure encapsulation. The main functionality will be
defined in the base class where the derived class will redirect to it. For type
parameter(s), we can share implementations for instantiation types with
identical binary representation like `int` and `long`. This will come at the
cost of reduce optimisation opportunities and increase overall object size.
