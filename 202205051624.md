# X Window System

X Window System (X11) is a graphical user interface (GUI) for #[202204081225](202204081225.md).
It can display windows, [fonts](202205051943.md)#, games or any graphical
components. Its configuration files could be seen at `/etc/` or `/etc/X11/`. It
has several implementations as shown below:

- [202205051707](202205051707.md)#
- [202205051716](202205051716.md)#

For remote access to the X server, it implements [202205182136](202205182136.md)# which listen
to port 177. Usually, #[202204081225](202204081225.md) distro will provide a [202205182153](202205182153.md)#

Command line utilities such as `xdpyinfo` could be used to display X
information. `xwininfo` is used to show window's X information, and options such
