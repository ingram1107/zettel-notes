- # Rust RefCell
  
  `RefCell<T>` (import it from `std::cell::RefCell`) is a kind of #[202111301656](202111301656.md) that implements single ownership but allows *interior mutability* which permits the mutation of data on immutable references. Unlike [202206221113](202206221113.md) and [202206221720](202206221720.md), it checks the [202206241126](202206241126.md)# in runtime rather in compile time. This means that instead of showing up as a compilation error, the program will still be able to be compiled but panic and exit if there is a violation of the borrowing rule.
  
  It provides two major methods: `borrow_mut` and `borrow`. `borrow_mut` will return a mutable reference (`RefMut<T>`) where one could alter the content of the referred variable there. `borrow` returns an immutable reference (`Ref<T>`) instead. `RefCell<T>` keeps track on how many `RefMut<T>` and `Ref<T>` are currently active, and panic the program if it detected abnormal occurrences of them that violate the borrowing rule.
  
  `RefCell<T>` can combine with [202206221720](202206221720.md) to allow multiple ownership on mutable reference. That being said, be aware of the possibility of having [202206251349](202206251349.md)#.
  
  However, it can't be used in a [multithreading environment](202207171457.md)# as it doesn't implement the [202204061235](202204061235.md)# [202207172210](202207172210.md)#.
