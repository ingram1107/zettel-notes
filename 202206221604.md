- # Rust Deref
  
  Deref is a #[202204061235](202204061235.md) that allows the dereferencing of a #data-structure or an `enum`. It is especially useful in #[202111301656](202111301656.md). All structures that implement the trait Deref must have the method `deref` implemented into them. This is shown as follow:
  
  ```rust
  use std::ops::Deref;
  
  impl<T> Deref for MyStruct<T> {
  type Target = T;
  
  fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
  	&self.0  // Assume MyStruct is a single element tuple
  }
  }
  ```
  
  **Note**: The method `deref` shall return a reference. This is to enforce an implicit Deref coercion that will be explained below.
  
  In Rust, there is a policy called Deref coercion. What it does is converts a reference to a type into a reference to another type. For example, Rust will convert `&String` to `&str` using `&String` `deref` method which return a `&str`. This policy will be enforced when the reference to a particular type is passed as a function or method argument, but it doesn't match the required or defined parameter type. Then, Rust will continuously call the `deref` method down the chain until it can satisfy the requirement, otherwise it will raise a compile error.
  
  There are some restrictions though. Mutable reference (`&mut T` with `DerefMut`) can be *converted into both* mutable reference and immutable reference (`&T` with `Deref`). An immutable reference *can only be converted* into another immutable reference.
