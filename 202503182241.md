# TCP Congestion Control

Congestion control in TCP is done at the sender side (see [End-to-End Congestion Control](202304261438.md)).
Congestion is detected through loss event such as *timeout* or *three duplicate
ACKs* (4 ACKs). Sender keeps track of a variable, congestion window (`cwnd`),
which imposes a constraint on sending rate. Including [TCP Flow Control](202304231611.md),
the amount of unacknowledged data at the sender may not exceed the minimum of
congestion window and receiver window (`rwnd`), as stated in the following
equation:

$$
\text{last byte sent} - \text{last byte acked} \le \text{min}\{\text{cwnd}, \text{rwnd}\}
$$

Assuming that `rwnd` is extremely large, we can see that `cwnd` limits the
amount of unacknowledged data at the sender, which indirectly limits the sending
rate. Thus, the sender's send rate is roughly `cwnd`/$RTT$ bytes/second. By
adjusting `cwnd` value, we can adjust the sending rate.

TCP has a **self-clocking** mechanism which can increase the transmit rate. This
is done by using the *ACK arrival rate* as indicator to increase the congestion
window's size accordingly.

To prevent the cases where TCP senders collectively send too fast or the link
bandwidth is under utilised, TCP adjusts its sending rate base on **lost
segment**, **acknowledged segment**, and **[bandwidth probing](202503192126.md)**.
Lost segment implies congestion, which TCP can reduce the sending rate. In
contrast, acknowledged segment implies well connection, and TCP can increase the
sending rate.
