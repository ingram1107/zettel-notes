# volatile

`volatile` is a keyword that hint on C or C++ compliers that the variable is
"observable", that is its behaviour is observable. It guarantees the declared
variable should not be [optimised](202302121739.md) since it could it changed
during runtime. It can be handy when there is a need of:
- hardware interaction such as driver, microcontroller etc.
- memory mapped files
- avoiding memory address being optimised for other purposes
- #multithreading

That being said, `volatile` doesn't prevent the reordering optimisation done by
the [Compiler](202302152015.md), especially in #multithreading environment.
This can only be prevented by [atomic functions](202503110313.md).
