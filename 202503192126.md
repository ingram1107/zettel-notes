# Bandwidth Probing

Bandwidth probing is a [TCP](202503182241.md)'s networking technique to adjust
the sending rate. The sender first increases sending rate according to ACK
arrival rate. When [Network Congestion](202209302043.md) is detected, it backs
off from that rate, then probes to see if the congestion onset rate has changed.
