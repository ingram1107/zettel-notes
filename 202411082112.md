# Rust Declarative Macro

To declare a [Rust declarative macro](202411082058.md), we should use the
specifier `macro_rules!`. The macro body resembles arm structure of `match`, and
in fact, it shares a similar mechanism to `match`, which compares value to
patterns associated with a particular code. A literal Rust code is passed to the
macro where the patterns were compared to the code structure. If there is a
match, it then replaces them with the associated code. The following Rust code
defines a simplified version of `vec!` macro:

```rs
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! vec {
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) => {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}
```

As we can see from above example, `$` is used to declare a macro variable within
`macro_rules!` body. The attribute `#[macro_export]` is used to activate macro
when the crate (where macro is in the scope) was imported to the project.

`expr` is a metavariable that match any Rust expression. Other metavariables
include `item`, `block` (block expression), `stmt` (statement), `pat_param`,
`pat`, `ty` (type), `ident` (identifier or keyword), `path`, `tt` (token tree),
`meta` (the contents of an attribute), `vis` (visibility qualifier), and
`literal` (literal expression).

`*` is a repetition operator that indicates any number of repetitions. Other
operators include `+` for any number but at least one and `?` for zero or one
occurence.
