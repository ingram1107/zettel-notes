# TCP Flow Control

[Flow Control](202209302245.md) done in [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
is by having a dynamic window size at the receiver side. To avoid possible
overflowing, the allocated receiver buffer (different from window, which is the
spare room in the buffer) must be larger than the result of difference between
the last byte received to the buffer and the last byte read from the buffer. We
can express this condition clearly in mathematical notation:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{last byte received} - \text{last byte read} &\le \text{receiver buffer}\\
\text{receiver window} &= \text{receiver buffer} - [\text{last byte received} -
\text{last byte read}]
\end{align}
$$

Initially, the receiver set the size of the receiver window as the size of the
receiver buffer in the ACK packet in the receiver window segment in the TCP
header. The receiver will later update the receiver window size accordingly.
There is a problem, if the receiver buffer is kept busy and the receiver window
is 0, the sender have to keep track of its size in order to be able to send out
the packet later in time. This is solved by letting the sender keep sending a
packet with one data byte (doesn't cause much [Network Congestion](202209302043.md))
until the receiver window is indicated larger than 1 from the receiver via ACK
packet.

On the sender side, it has to keep track of the difference between the last byte
sent and the last byte acknowledged by itself so that they won't be larger than
the receiver window. Note that the difference between the last byte sent and the
last byte acknowledged by itself is the number of unacknowledged packet sent by
the sender. We can understand this condition with the following mathematical
notation:

$$
\text{last byte sent} - \text{last byte acknowledged} \le \text{receiver window}
$$
