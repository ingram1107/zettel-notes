# Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)

ATM is a connection-oriented [Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md)
technology operating at [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md) with fixed length
packets or [cells](202303292214.md) that can integrate different traffic types
such as voice, data, and video. It supports both #[Packet Switching](202207150848.md)
and #[Circuit Switching](202207150846.md) functionalities. The basic components
in an ATM network are ATM [switches](202207051907.md)#, which is responsible for
moving cells through the network, and ATM endpoints, such as workstations,
[Router](202207061800.md), data service units (DSU) etc. However, ATM is complex
and expensive, thus largely been succeeded by [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md).

Switches are interconnected by point-to-point ATM links, which could come in 2
forms: **User-Network Interface (UNI)** and **Network Node Interface (NNI)**.
The former is used to connect ATM endpoints to ATM switches, whereas the latter
connect ATM switches together. Depend on the type of network (private or public)
the switch reside, it could be further classified as **private** or **public**
interface.

ATM supports **asynchronous transmission** using an optimised version of
[Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)](202209091302.md)#. Since in standard TDM, an
end station could not use an idle time slot owned by another end station, this
could result in some inefficiency. Instead of favouring static allocation, ATM
improves it letting the end stations to choose their slot based on **priority**.
The slot that has the highest priority is the primary time slot for that end
station. If the slot is not being used by its primary owner, it can be assigned
to other end station temporarily to transmit data over.

The information or frame transferred by ATM will have a *fixed size* of 53
bytes, where 5 bytes are allocated for header and 48 bytes for information.
Because of its predictable size, it eases the network management and the
debugging process chore as the serialisation delay or the delay of processing
cells is deterministic. This is particularly useful in voice and video traffic
since they are time-sensitive (though its advantages has been chipped away as
the wide adoption of [Voice over IP (VoIP)](202303201850.md)). However, it does
add to the network overhead. For example, suppose ATM wants to transfer 100
bytes of information, it needs to split it up to 3 frames, where 15 bytes of
them are allocated to headers instead of being used to carry the information.

As a connection-based service, ATM requires that the connection must be
requested, established, and confirmed before any operation on sending user
information over the network. Each connection is composed of virtual channels
and virtual paths. Virtual channels, which could take different physical paths
through the network, are bundled into a single logical group: virtual path.
Multiple virtual paths will be bundled into a larger logical grouping called
transmission path.

There are two kinds of circuits primary used by
ATM: [Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)](202208301245.md)# and
[Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC)](202208301240.md)# . The latter is quite common
among ATM installation. ATM also utilises the [LAN Emulation (LANE)](202209221816.md)#
technology, which offer user the ability to communicate using
[Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md) protocols within the ATM network.
