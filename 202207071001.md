# Distance Vector Routing Protocol

In Distance Vector Routing, the #[Routers](202207061800.md) share their
[Routing Table](202210112056.md) with their *direct neighbour(s)* (often termed
"routing by rumour") periodically. The table stores *routing information* which
describes the *direction* (router and the corresponding port) where the packets
should be forwarded to and the *distance* using one of the metrics (See in
#[Routing Protocol](202207061815.md)). When a router receives the information
via this method, it will undergo a process called **distance accumulation**,
that is, increments the distance by one. By this way, routers within the network
are ignorant to its topology. The process is usually done by the Bellman-Ford
algorithm.

Although the protocol is blessed by its simplicity, it doesn't scale well when
the number of routers grows larger and larger, which could make the routing
table extremely large. The exchange of such information can be quite expensive,
and would degrade the network performance as a result.

It is best used [simple and flat network](202206280939.md) or specific types of
networks such as [hub-and-spoke networks](202210242045.md)#. If the worst-case
[Convergence](202210242111.md)# times in the network is not a concern, which is
the worst disadvantage of using a
Distance Vector Routing Protocol.

Examples of such protocol:
- [Routing Information Protocol (RIP)](202210160908.md)#
- [RIP version 2 (RIPv2)](202211060854.md)#
- IGRP
- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP, available for both
  [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md) and [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md), use
  bandwidth and delay as metrics)
- RIPng (RIP next generation, for [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md))
