# Sporadic E

Sporadic E is a phenomenon where radio signals are reflected back to the Earth
by highly ionised segments in the ionosphere. A strong two-way communication can
be established during Sporadic E openings, which can last around few minutes to
several hours (though rare). The range may rarely exceed 1000 km. High power and
high gain antenna is not necessary to achieve such performance.
