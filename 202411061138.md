# Cron

Cron is used to schedule jobs to be executed. User Crontabs are generally stored
in the subdirectories in `/var/spool/cron/` that are named after the username.
System Crontab is defined either in the file `/etc/crontab` or files in the
directory `/etc/crno.d`. [Linux](202204081225.md) distro prepares directories
like `/etc/cron.hourly/` (Arch Linux) or `/etc/cron.d/hourly` for Crontabs to be
executed in an interval.

The general syntax to define a Crontab is shown below:

```
minute  hour  day-of-month  month  day-of-week  username  command
```

Minute should have the value between 0 and 59. Hour should have the value
between 0 and 23. The value for day of month should be between 1 and 31. Month
can be expressed in digital (from 1 to 12) or in first three characters of their
name (`jan`, `feb`, ..., `dec`). The day of week can also be expressed in both
digital form (from 0 to 7, where 0 and 7 both are recognised as Sunday) or in
first three characters of their name (`sun`, `mon`, ..., `sat`).

Some special characters can be used to express broader period. `*` states that
any value is acceptable. `,` is useful for listing possible values that are not
contiguous. `-` defines a range of value. `/` defines the step value.

Crontab also defines some time specification such as `@reboot`, `@hourly`,
`@daily` or `@midnight`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, and `@yearly` or `@annually`.

**Note**: In user Crontab, the field `username` can be omitted.

To edit the Crontab as a user, we can execute `crontab -e`. To list defined
Crontabs, `crontab -l` should be run. `crontab -r` is used to remove Crontab.
`crontab -u` is used to specify the name of the user whose Crontab should be
modified, but this requires root privilege.

Files like `/etc/cron.allow` or `/etc/cron.deny` can be used to restrict the
access to the command `crontab` from non-root user.
