# Abbasid Caliphate

Abbasid Caliphate is the successor of [Umayyad Caliphate](202302241657.md) after
the Abbasid Revolution that ruled from 752 to 1258. It got its name due to the
royals are the descendants of Abbas bin Abdul Muthalib, the paternal uncle and
one of the companion of the prophet Muhammad. During the period of Abbasid
dynasty, the capital moved from Umayyad's Damascus to Baghdad, which were built
by the second Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur. Due to its origin from Khorosan, Abbasid
courts were heavily influenced by Persian style, and highly tolerant to
non-Arab, peculiarly Mawla (those who newly converted). That being said,
Shi'ites were oppressed even though they had gave support to the Abbasid
movement initially. During the reign of Caliph Harun ar-Rasyid (786-809) and
al-Ma'mun (813-833), the Caliphate was flourished by [scientific and #math advancement](202501072311.md) 
 despite a brief civil war between Harun's two sons al-Amin and al-Ma'mun. A
 combination of decay of Tigris-Euphrates as trade powerhouse and internal and
 external threats, Caliph Al-Mu'tasim (833-842) and al-Wathiq (842-847) created
 Mamluk, an army composed mainly of Turkic slaves. The Mamluk later gained
 significant political power in Abbasid court in which the Caliph eventually
 became the puppet of the Mamluk and eventually established their own rule
 (Bahriyya Mamluks and Burji after the fall of Ayyubid). From 945 onwards, local
 governors and forces become de facto independent of Abbasid Caliphate. Its
 total destruction was brought by Hulagu Khan from Mongol after the siege of
 Baghdad which resulted in the dead of the last Abbasid Caliphate and burning of
 several valuable book collections.
