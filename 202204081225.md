# Linux

Linux is a #[free](202110161030.md) and #[open source](202110161031.md)
[Kernel](202210062254.md)# based on Unix, first initiated and developed by Linus
Torvalds. Most of the time, Linux is coupled alongside with GNU utilities to
compose a complete operating system which are contributed by Richard Stallman
and Free Software Foundation (FSF) where they prefer to refer such combination
as GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux.

In the following section, I will use Linux to refer to the kernel and the
operating system interchangeably.

The superuser on Linux is called **root**, which will have a user ID of 0. It
has the highest possible privileges within the operating system.

## File related functionalities

As Linux follows the [Unix Philosophy](202207142105.md)# (or partly), almost all
devices or objects are treated as a file. File is an important logic entity on
Linux that one should pay attention if they want to master it. The following
topics are related to file or its operation.

- [File Descriptor](202210172248.md)#
- [Linux File Systems](202202060057.md)#
- [Linux File Types](202210172256.md)#
- [Linux Directory Structure](202210172229.md)#
- [Linux User's Home Directory Skeleton](202410241115.md)

## Power Management

`shutdown`, with neither the option `-h` nor `-r`, will run at runlevel 1
([SysVinit](202408291124.md)) with duration formatted in `hh::mm`, `+m`, or
`now`/`+0`.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Linux has several GUI to display bitmap. There are several implementations as
shown below:

- [X Window System](202205051624.md)#
- Wayland

## Resource Control and Security Facilities

Linux provides some facilities to simplify the resource management and fine
control on security. The framework or facilities are shown below:
- [Control Groups (Cgroups)](202204071051.md)#
- [Namespace Isolation](202203281429.md)#
- [Security Computer Mode (Seccomp)](202205081830.md)#
- [Linux Security Modules (LSM)](202205081842.md)#

## Distributions

There are tons of Linux distributions with different flavour of desktop
environment and default programs. The following shows them:

- [openSUSE](202205192257.md)#
- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](202205251159.md)#
- [Fedora](202210012320.md)#
- [Ubuntu](202210012322.md)#
- Mandriva Linux
- [Debian](202210012324.md)#
- Mageia
- Gentoo
