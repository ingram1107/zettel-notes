# Type Driven Development

Type driven development relies on strong type-check feature of programming
languages (like [Rust](202410042152.md) and #haskell). It avoids [Shotgun Parsing](202501082147.md).

It recommends using the most precise data structure that makes illegal states
unrepresentable and constructing [Total Functions](202501082113.md) to avoid
type validations during runtime. In the case of function,
[King](lit/@King2019.md) suggests strengthening the argument type of the
function to guarantee information to be returned, either in the form of intended
type (`Some`) or error type (`Nothing`). The burden of proof should be done at
the boundary of the system before any of the data is acted upon. In King's word,
"write functions on the data representation you wish you had".

Denormalisation on data representation should be avoided, especially on those
that are of *mutable*. However, if it is necessary, encapsulation on the data
should be done in order to keep the representations in sync. If an illegal state
is truly unrepresentable, King recommends to use abstract data types to make
validators look like parsers.

Strong-type guarantee comes with a drawback, which is especially evident in
dynamically-typed languages, where sometimes it is required for the value to be
parsed before being actually used.
