# Project Life Cycle

Project life cycle is a collection of [Project](202303251004.md) phases which
may be varied in different projects or industries. A single project life cycle
might include several [products](202303251030.md). Typically, it includes:
1. Concept Phase (management plan, preliminary cost estimate, 3-level
  [WBS](202303251021.md))
2. Development Phase (project plan, budgetary cos estimate, 6+-level WBS)
3. Implementation Phase (last work package, definitive cost estimate,
  #performance reports)
4. Support Phase (completed work, lessons, customer acceptance)

It is recommended to have *management reviews* after each phase (phase exists or
kill points) to evaluate the project's progress, likely success, and continued
compatibility with organisational goals (detect deviations).
